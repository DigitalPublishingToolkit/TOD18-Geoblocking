# Brazil: Netflix, VPNs and the ‘Paying’ Pirates

###Vanessa Mendes Moreira de Sa


<div class="statbox">
- 60%: Proportion of the total population in Brazil that has access to the
internet
- 37th: Netflix is the 37^th^ most visited website in Brazil (Alexa
ranking)
- 2.2 million: Estimated number of subscribers to Netflix Brazil
- 38%: Proportion of VPN users from Brazil who have accessed the US Netflix in December 2014

</div>

From late 2014, the ‘news’ that Netflix had started to block anonymous
or unidentified IP addresses spread all over the internet. The overall
reaction from Brazilians who used location-masking practices presented
similarities to the universal five stages of loss and grief[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_1]:

1\. Denial and Isolation:

‘I use ‘Hola’ to see the American Netflix. If Netflix decides to block
me, I will go back to Torrents and Netflix will lose a customer’.

2\. Anger:

‘Media corporations are stupid and greedy. People will go back to
Torrents!’

3\. Bargaining:

‘If I only have access to half the catalogue, I should only have to pay
for half the catalogue. It should be my right to access what I want and
the way I want’.

4\. Depression:

‘Why are they imposing such limitations? I use VPN to practice my
English...’ \[Netflix Brazil does not offer subtitles in English yet\].

5\. Acceptance:

‘That’s the way things work and they won’t change. However, it is a
setback, and it is against the reality of globalization.’

Netflix is the 37^th^ most visited website in Brazil.[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_2] It arrived in
2011, and with over two million subscribers in 2015, Brazil is the
world’s second fastest growing country in terms of subscriber numbers.
However, it does not completely meet consumers’ demands for a number of
reasons, including the limited catalogue available and the lack of
English subtitles. Therefore, many Brazilians are turning to VPNs and
proxy servers to get access to the US Netflix video library or
geoblocked websites from the US and other countries. In fact, recent
market research[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_3] suggests Brazil is the third-largest VPN market in
the world. The country also has the third largest number of unauthorized
users on the U.S. Netflix site.

Brazil accounts for a considerable share of the global informal
audience. In addition to VPN and proxy use, previous research estimates
that over 20 million Brazilians are involved in illegal downloading on a
daily basis.[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_4] Brazil is the largest South American country and as one
of the five BRICS nations (along with Russia, India, China and South
Africa) it also holds an important position as a major emerging
economy.[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_5] Its media landscape is shaped by local, European, Hispanic
and Anglo-American influences – and as an enclave of Portuguese within
South America’s Spanish-language media ecology, it has a particularly
complex and cosmopolitan media landscape. For all these reasons, Brazil
warrants attention as a unique site for understanding global media
flows, both formal and informal.

This chapter investigates how Brazilian television audiences create an
alternative system of TV viewing through geoblocking circumvention
practices. My analysis draw on various sources, including articles and
editorials from newspapers, magazines and blogs, as well as online
reader comments, forums, and other online spaces where these practices
are discussed.

## Overview of the Media and Digital Landscape in Brazil

To understand TV streaming in Brazil, it is important to consider the
context in which these activities take place. Limited access is the main
reason why people download media. As in most nations, Brazil’s TV system
is shaped by broadcast rights and licensing arrangements that often
result in delays or the total unavailability of television shows.
Audiences in Brazil who wish to watch American TV shows may have to wait
months, or even years, until they can see these shows locally.
Furthermore, much of the population is priced out of the market for
legal DVDs, which are too expensive for the poorest communities.

Since the 1950s, US TV shows have been popular with Brazilian audiences.
In the early 1970s the government started to invest in national
television production to minimize the reliance on U.S. imports. Ever
since then, Brazilian telenovelas have become increasingly popular as
well as nationally and internationally recognized for the quality of
their plots and production. Local telenovelas have a wide audience and
are mostly offered on free-to-air television.[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_6] In contrast, U.S. TV
shows are primarily aired on cable television.[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_7]

What is generally understood, in regards to Latin American television
programming, is that free-to-air TV caters to the mass audience while
cable caters to elites, and the advertisers that target them. In late
2014, there were over 19 million subscribers to cable television in
Brazil, which corresponds to 29% of households.[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_8] Having a cable
connection is an essential status symbol for the middle classes.
Surprisingly, about 33% of cable subscribers only watch free-to-air
television channels: they pay for the service to get a better signal or
to not feel ‘inferior’ to friends and family who have cable
television.[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_9] Cable audiences are also concentrated in the southeast
region,[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_10] the most populated and urbanized area of the country,
composed of the states of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais and
Espirito Santo. While Brazilian free-to-air TV offers relatively good
quality content, people are starting to want access to a wider selection
of programming. However, not everyone can afford the cost of a cable
connection, which means that TV viewing in Brazil is organized along
class lines.

Socio-economic inequalities also shape internet access and use in
Brazil. Although internet access has grown in the 2000s for a number of
reasons – including falling broadband prices, federal government
investment in school computers, and free wi-fi in public spaces –
internet access is still restricted to a portion of the population. In
Brazil, 120 million people (60% of the total population) have access to
the internet, and 48% of these users have home connections.[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_11]
Internet access at home is most common in highly populated cities with
high concentrations of wealthy people, such as Sao Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro, and less common in rural states such as Maranhao and
Piaui.[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_12]

These socio-economic factors help to explain the uneven take-up of video
streaming in Brazil. In recent years streaming services have multiplied
as telcos and media companies invest in VOD platforms. Figure 1
illustrates some of the services available:

|Service|Availability|Price (US$)|No of videos|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Netflix|Available to the general public|$6.60 per month|1500+|
|Now |NET HD subscribers|Free / from \$1.30 per title|       20,000+|
|Cine Sky HD|Sky HDTV subscribers|From \$3.30 per title              |36|
|Sky Online|Sky subscribers|$5.20 per month or pay per view  | 2,300+|
|Vivo Play|Available to the general public|$5.20 per month|5000|
|GVT on demand|GVT subscribers only|Free / $1 per video|5000|
|ClaroVideo|Available to the general public|$4.60 per month or pay per view|1200+|
|HBOGo|HBO/Max on Sky subscribers only|Free for cable subscribers|1500+|
|Telecine Play|Telecine subscribers only|Free for cable subscribers|1500+|
|Muu|Globasat subscribers only|Free for cable subscribers|3000|

However, despite the proliferation of legal streaming services,
Brazilian internet TV viewing is still substantially informal in nature.
Like the vibrant pirate DVD economy, which is still a strong feature of
Brazil’s urban streetscapes, unauthorized TV streaming and downloading
is a mainstream practice.

On the internet, it is possible to find a great number of user-led
informal video networks provided by Brazilian audiences. Torrents, still
the most popular option in Brazil, can be easily accessed from major
trackers like The Pirate Bay as well as numerous local websites, such as
Filmesviatorrents.com.br which maintains an organized database of films,
television shows and anime. File-hosting websites and cloud storage
platforms are also used to share video content, with catalogues
organized by title, season and episode number. Generally, they are
offered with subtitles in Portuguese. Brazilian internet culture has
also produced sophisticated fan-driven translation systems. The
*legender* (fansubber) community translates Western television shows and
films, mostly from the US and UK, into Brazilian Portuguese.

Streaming unauthorized material from YouTube is another popular option.
Users have uploaded countless films and television shows on YouTube,
which are available in dubbed versions or with subtitles in Portuguese.
Further, global entertainment companies often make available on their
websites, or Facebook pages, teasers, promos, trailers and sneak peeks
of television shows and films. Often this content is geoblocked.
However, after observing the Facebook page of US networks like ABC and
NBC, I noticed that within a couple of hours after the videos have been
released, it was possible to find them on YouTube with subtitles in
Portuguese. The most popular informal video streaming website in Brazil,
which has a catalogue of films and television content[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_13], is
MegafilmesHD.net. They claim to have over 23,000 films in their archive.
Another informal streaming service is Popcorn Time, which promotes its
own (paid) VPN service (VPN.ht) so that audiences can use it
anonymously.

It is also important to consider the legal context to these practices.
Recent years have seen a number of significant developments in Brazil,
most notably the passing in 2014 of Brazil’s pioneering *Marco Civil*
law \[Civil Rights Framework for the Internet\]. Like a Bill of Rights
for the Brazilian internet, the *Marco Civil* ‘\[e\]stablishes
principles, guarantees, rights and obligations related to the use of the
Internet in Brazil,’[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_14] introducing a safe harbor system and setting
out principles for national internet governance, including net
neutrality, freedom of expression, and the right to privacy. The bill is
viewed internationally as a significant development for expression and
civil rights online. Other BRICS countries have pursued more restrictive
internet governance systems as a response to the piracy problem. In
contrast, Brazil has taken a dramatically different approach:

> …as soon as Brazil signed Marco Civil into law, it became the largest
> country to enshrine net neutrality in its legal code, among its other
> welcome provisions on privacy, intermediary liability and
> accessibility and openness of the internet…With Marco Civil passed
> into law, Brazil, in its domestic law, is asserting itself as a
> potential world leader in internet freedom.[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_15]

The *Marco Civil* is currently undergoing another revision including a
public consultation process. In early 2015, Netflix executives joined
the discussion, declaring their support for the bill and reassuring
their Brazilian subscribers that they would not experience any issues.
However, the *Marco Civil* is yet to address VPNs and geographic
circumvention practices.

Enforcement of internet and piracy laws in Brazil remains patchy. When
it comes to copyright crime, penalties are rarely enforced because of
limited policing capacity. Given Brazil’s overcrowded jails, copyright
infringement is treated as a minor infraction. The government prefers to
invest in copyright education rather than prosecution. The high levels
of digital piracy in Brazil, therefore, appear to be a result of (but
not limited to) a lack of law enforcement, the high cost of accessing
cable television, and restricted access to international video content
in general.

##Circumventing Geoblocking in Brazil Through VPN and Proxy ‘Pirata’

A quick search of Brazilian internet sites will produce hundreds of
piracy and circumvention resources, such as VPN and proxy services,
step-by step instructions in blogs, video tutorials on YouTube, and
numerous advice articles and FAQs. Some of the websites and blogs have
illustrated step-by-step guides on ‘how to set up a VPN’ or ‘how to use
proxy to camouflage your IP address’. As with user-generated torrents,
subbing and streaming services, the VPN ‘pirate’ network is highly
collaborative.

Circumvention tools have many uses in Brazil. Some people use VPN and
proxy services to access websites that are blocked in the location where
they are accessing internet from, such as libraries, schools and at
work. Therefore, they use these services to access websites such as
those with video content (e.g. YouTube) or social media, such as
Facebook. Proxy services such as Unlocator are often preferred for their
superior speeds; these may be more suited to streaming than encryption
services. In my observation of circumvention communities I also noticed
that many Brazilians recommend Hola Unblocker as an alternative to the
paid and more complex VPNs. The Hola browser plugin is free to install
and use – but as noted in the Introduction to this book, it has been
known to sell user bandwidth to third parties for botnet attacks.

There are also audiences that want to access video content from their
original sources. For instance, since late 2014, accessing the US
Netflix catalogue has been a popular discussion topic in Brazilian
internet forums. There are two main motivations for accessing the US
Netflix service. First, Netflix Brazil has a limited catalogue: the US
version offers many times more content, whereas the local version
generally offers a lot of content that has already screened widely in
Brazil. Second, Netflix subtitles are only available in Portuguese;
there are no English captions available, as in the U.S. Netflix service.
This is a source of disappointment for the many Brazilian students who
use captions to practice their English language skills. They naturally
prefer the U.S. service.

![](imgs/Vanessa_Image1.png)

Figure 1. English captions on streaming content are highly valued by some
Brazilian internet users, especially language students

Interestingly enough, Brazilian Netflix fans have also produced a
Portuguese subtitling workaround for those using the U.S. site. There
are many tutorials on how to incorporate subtitles created by amateur
subtitlers, such as the Legenders, into the video content available in
the U.S. Netflix.

In terms of understanding these practices as piracy, I have frequently
observed in forums that the argument ‘if I pay for a Netflix
subscription in Brazil, I should be able to access the US catalogue’ was
often used. There is also an ‘all or nothing’ attitude, with many users
stating that ‘if Netflix start blocking my VPN I will move to Popcorn
Time, downloads, and torrents’. I did notice however, that there were
many people in these discussions either defending Netflix Brazil,
accepting their policies – to a certain extent – on geoblocking and
distributions rights.

I have also noticed a certain willingness to pay for access to content
among Netflix VPN pirates, which is quite different from the attitude of
audiences that informally download content.[^14MendesMoreiradeSaBrazil_16] Some Netflix
subscribers even mentioned that they have minimized or even ceased
torrenting since they signed up for the service. Everyone who mentioned
the monthly subscription of R\ 19.90 (about USD6) per month said the
price was fair.

Once again, it is important to note that only 60% of the population in
Brazil have access to the internet. Among them, over two million people
subscribe to the Netflix Brazil service and of this number, only certain
users have the tech know-how and English skills to be a Netflix VPN
pirate (assuming that they use their Netflix Brazil account details to
connect to the US Netflix). This is an elite community – highly
educated, middle-class people from the cities. They are the target
audience not only for Netflix but for other VOD services.

##Paying Pirates or Netflix Audiences?

The popularity of Netflix in Brazil not only reflects the growing
interest in VOD but also illustrates a great demand from early adopters
who are not satisfied with free-to-air and pay-TV. Yet, for many
audiences the limited Netflix Brazil catalogue is the main motivation
for using VPNs to access the U.S. service.

Netflix’s CEO, Reed Hastings, has mentioned that they plan to end the
geoblocking of their services one day, however negotiating intellectual
property on a global scale is complex. Geographic circumvention is a
competitive informal business model. It can be predatory, it can be
collaborative but above all, it can inform industry about unmet demand
and market gaps. The many different ways of circumventing geoblocks in
Brazil raises questions about the differences between pirates versus
audiences. Are they paying VPN pirates or legitimate Netflix audiences?
