####
In mid-October 2012, Netflix flew its top three executives, co-founder
and CEO Reed Hastings, Chief Product Officer Neil Hunt, and Chief
Content Officer Ted Sarandos over to Sweden to have cocktails with a
group of journalists at an upscale bar in the heart of Stockholm.
Netflix had just launched its streaming service in the small
Scandinavian country and, for all intents and purposes, needed the
promotional power only their senior staff could provide. The company had
announced its plans to launch in Sweden and some of the other Nordic
countries only a few months before, on 15 August. Later that day, Time
Warner informed the press that it would also launch a subscription-based
video streaming service, HBO Nordic, in the same region sometime in the
fall of 2012. All of a sudden, Sweden, a country of less than ten
million people located in the periphery of Europe, was set to be host to
two of the biggest names in streaming video. By the end of the year,
both platforms were up and running. As time passed, however, it became
clear that neither Netflix nor HBO Nordic were able to dominate online
video in Sweden. Both of them launched into an oversaturated media
landscape, with plenty of streaming video options, authorized and
unauthorized, already competing for the viewer’s attention.

While this overprovision of streaming video services has managed to
crush the financial hopes of Netflix and Time Warner executives alike,
it has, together with certain socio-technical and legal preconditions,
contributed considerably to turning Sweden into something of a
streamer’s paradise. Yet, as I will show in this chapter, not everything
is rosy for Swedish Internet users. With the Swedish government trying
to negotiate between its political duties within the European Union and
its cyberlibertarian national politics that have made the country a
haven for Internet users, many Swedes have turned to VPN services to
circumvent politically motivated data retention practices, and protect
their privacy.

## Video Streaming Platforms in Sweden

The Swedish media landscape is host to a plethora of local and offshore
video streaming platforms. Viewers can choose between video streaming
options from public service and commercial broadcasters, pay TV
operators, and telecommunications companies alongside
subscription-based, transactional, and advertising-supported streaming
services, and a growing number of unauthorized alternatives.

Local video streaming platforms are predominantly in the hands of four
media companies that dominate the Swedish television market: the public
service broadcaster Sveriges Television, as well as its commercial
counterparts Modern Times Group, TV4 Group, and SBS Discovery Media. All
of these companies provide catch up TV services in addition to their
free-to-air offerings, making previously broadcast programs available to
stream for a limited time. Most notable here are SVT Play, TV3 Play, TV4
Play, as well as Kanal 5 Play. In addition to these free services, the
major commercial networks also offer subscription-based video streaming
platforms. These include ad-free versions of certain catch up TV
services (TV4 Play Premium or Kanal 5 Play Premium), comprehensive
online extensions to traditional pay TV services, such as Viaplay or C
More Play, as well as standalone products like the movie and television
series streaming platform Filmnet. Furthermore, viewers have the
possibility to subscribe to aggregator streaming services such as Magine
TV or Telia Play Plus, which package content from a number of public
service and commercial broadcasters, as well as pay TV operators.
Finally, there are transactional video streaming platforms, such as SF
Anytime, Headweb, film2home, or Plejmo, that allow viewers to purchase
movies and television shows, or rent them for a limited time (usually 48
hours).

A number of offshore video streaming platforms, predominantly from the
United States, join these Swedish providers. The two services dominating
the North American video streaming market, Netflix and YouTube, are
present in Sweden as well.[^12BaumannSweden_1] Both of these services have a very
similar look and feel in Sweden compared to their home market. However,
the same cannot be said about their content libraries. YouTube is
primarily a platform for user-generated and corporately sponsored
content and is able to offer the great majority of content uploaded to
its servers also in Sweden. In contrast, Netflix, as a premium
subscription service, maintains different content libraries in its home
country and the various international markets it operates, subject to
varying license agreements. Swedish viewers also have the option to
subscribe to Time Warner’s HBO Nordic, a standalone video streaming
service that offers access to the entire HBO library, including the
company’s latest television episodes twenty-four hours after they have
been broadcast in the United States.

Given this abundance of local and offshore platforms, it is maybe
surprising that YouTube and Netflix alone are responsible for more than
half of the overall consumption of legal streaming video in Sweden.[^12BaumannSweden_2]
In a country of just over 8.7 million Internet users YouTube accounts
for 1.3 million viewers every day.[^12BaumannSweden_3] Netflix falls behind with 465,000
daily viewers; however, with this number still has a lead in the Swedish
subscription video streaming market, beating local and offshore
competitors in this category, including Viaplay (198,000), TV4 Play
Premium (60,000), HBO Nordic (34,000), and C More Play (17,000).[^12BaumannSweden_4] In
the free catch up TV market, Sveriges Television, which was the first
Swedish broadcaster to establish a video streaming service, has a
commanding lead over its commercial competitors with 57 percent of all
video streams coming through its SVT Play platform.[^12BaumannSweden_5]

In addition to the many authorized local and offshore video streaming
options, there are an increasing number of unauthorized services
competing for the attention of Swedish viewers. Probably the most
visible of them is Swefilmer, a website that provides free access to
pirated copies of thousands of movies and television shows hosted on a
small server farm in Russia.[^12BaumannSweden_6] What makes the platform stand out is
its attempt to appeal to a local audience. Besides offering the latest
Hollywood content, Swefilmer makes a substantial amount of Swedish
productions available to stream. Many of the video files come with
Swedish subtitles hardcoded into them, and the website’s interface is
only available in Swedish. What differentiates the platform even further
is the fact that it operates in a legal gray zone. Curiously, watching a
video stream is an extralegal activity in Sweden, as the visitor of a
website cannot necessarily be certain if the material he/she watches was
obtained rightfully or not. For these reasons, Swefilmer has attracted
considerable public attention, and copycat websites such as Dreamfilm,
Swesub.tv, and Sweflix have imitated its model.[^12BaumannSweden_7] A further
unauthorized video streaming alternative is Popcorn Time, a downloadable
open source BitTorrent client with integrated media player, whose
polished user interface recalls commercial platforms like Netflix or HBO
Nordic. As opposed to gray services such as Swefilmer, however, Popcorn
Time’s reliance on BitTorrent technology means that the viewer is likely
to break local law when using the software, as it is illegal to upload
copyrighted material in Sweden.

## High Speeds/Low Spending

Arguably the most important reason for this overprovision of video
streaming services in Sweden is the country’s unique Internet
infrastructure. The Internet did not spread particularly fast in Sweden
during the 1990s, at least not compared to a country like the United
States where it was originally conceived. However, whereas both
broadband penetration and speeds have leveled out in many OECD
countries, they continue to increase in Sweden. The Scandinavian country
ranks third in the World Economic Forum’s Network Readiness Index for
2014 with its ‘world-class, affordable ICT infrastructure’ and ‘one of
the highest technological and non-technological innovation performances
in the world’.[^12BaumannSweden_8] Today, 91 percent of the Swedish population have
access to the Internet, a number that increases to a staggering 97
percent in the age group 16 to 54.[^12BaumannSweden_9] Broadband is available in 88
percent of Swedish households, with 61 percent of homes and enterprises
having access to downstream connections of at least 100 Mbit/s.[^12BaumannSweden_10]
Yet, despite these numbers, prices for fixed broadband remain
comparatively low in Sweden. With true fiber connections costing from
SEK 199 per month, the country ranks third cheapest globally for
Internet connections of 100 Mbit/s or more.[^12BaumannSweden_11]

It is predominantly because of this promising infrastructural
arrangement that major U.S. media companies such as Netflix and Time
Warner have expanded into the small Scandinavian country in the first
place. In several interviews with the local press, Netflix executives
were quick to point out the country’s unique socio-technical conditions
for the dissemination of digital media. Speaking to a handful of
journalists on the eve of Netflix’s Swedish launch, CEO Reed Hastings
noted that ‘\[t\]he Nordic countries constitute one of the most advanced
markets for new services and technologies, and particularly Sweden…both
for its high broadband speeds and its people who tend to be early
adopters.’[^12BaumannSweden_12] Chief Product Officer Neil Hunt seemed to agree with the
remarks, adding that the company found the country’s Internet
infrastructure to be much better than anywhere else they had previously
been. For Time Warner, too, Sweden continues to play a significant role.
In 2012 the decision to make HBO’s entire library available to stream as
a standalone subscription service under the moniker of HBO Nordic raised
many eyebrows in Sweden, and abroad.[^12BaumannSweden_13] However, in light of the
company’s recent announcement to launch its HBO Now video streaming
service—essentially a carbon copy of HBO Nordic destined for the U.S.
market—it can be argued that the Nordic countries, and Sweden in
particular, served as a test market for the media giant, and a
convenient way to quietly launch their new flagship video streaming
product.

As promising as this arrangement appears from a corporate perspective,
however, it has surprisingly not resulted in any sizable consumer
spending on subscription or transaction-based video streaming services.
Swedes are generally open towards making their purchases online, with 85
percent of Internet users regularly buying and paying for items or
services via the Internet.[^12BaumannSweden_14] Yet, whereas purchases of home
electronics or clothes over the Internet have surged in recent years,
sales of digital media have not contributed nearly as much.[^12BaumannSweden_15] The
numbers are somewhat improving in the music sector, where the Swedish
company Spotify has helped to increase the number of users paying for
music online from 15 percent in 2011 to 38 percent in 2014. In the
online video sector, however, consumer spending is considerably lower as
the great majority of content is still accessed for free. Only 14
percent of all Swedish Internet users subscribed to a video streaming
service in 2014.[^12BaumannSweden_16] The reasons behind this comparatively low spending
on online video in Sweden are complex, with unauthorized streaming
services such as Swefilmer, or peer-to-peer file sharing facilitated
through third-party platforms like Popcorn Time or The Pirate Bay
certainly contributing to this phenomenon. Yet, as Patrick Vonderau has
demonstrated, pirating alone fails to explain why revenues generated
through legal online video platforms remain so low.[^12BaumannSweden_17] Rather, we
should be looking at the overprovision of free video services in Sweden,
including the many free catch up TV services and the immensely popular
YouTube, alongside easy-to-access unauthorized platforms like Swefilmer
and Popcorn Time, if we want to begin to understand this development.

## Privacy Matters

Given Sweden’s comparatively strong digital infrastructure and
historically laissez-faire approach towards Internet use and censorship,
it is easy to see why the country is often described as the prototypical
cyberlibertarian information economy. It should not come as a surprise,
then, that Sweden was always decidedly reluctant about the 2006 EU Data
Retention Directive, which required EU member states to store citizens’
telecommunications data, for up to two years. In 2010, The European
Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that Sweden had to follow the other member
states and implement the directive. However, it was not until the spring
of 2012 that the Swedish government gave in and adopted measures
transposing the directive into local legislation. Yet, this collection
of Swedish call records and Internet metadata would only last for two
years. In April 2014 the ECJ had a change of heart and declared the Data
Retention Directive invalid, describing it as a ‘serious interference
with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the
protection of personal data.’[^12BaumannSweden_18] Following the ruling, the Swedish
Post and Telecom Authority (*Post- och telestyrelsen*) was quick to give
Swedish telcos and ISPs the go ahead to stop collecting customer data.
All of the major companies obliged without hesitation, with some of them
going as far as to delete all old customer records.[^12BaumannSweden_19] The pause on
data retention in Sweden was to be brief, however, as in another ruling
in October 2014, Swedish communications companies were ordered to start
collecting customer metadata yet again.[^12BaumannSweden_20]

The drama around data retention in Sweden reflects the country’s efforts
to negotiate between its political duties within a European context and
its libertarian digital politics that have made it a haven for Internet
users. In recent years, many Swedish Internet users have turned to VPN
services to protect their privacy and avoid the crossfire between
authorities and ISPs. Curiously, in their quest for privacy Swedish
Internet users are even supported by some of the companies that are
supposed to collect data about them. In trying to avoid a fine of 5
million Swedish Kronor for its refusal to comply with local data
retention rules, the Swedish ISP Bahnhof decided to offer a free VPN
service to all of its customers the day it had to resume storing
metadata.[^12BaumannSweden_21] Explaining the somewhat surprising move, Bahnhof CEO Jon
Karlung said: ‘The European Court of Justice has ruled that it is a
human right to not have your Internet traffic monitored. We therefore
believe that the time is ripe for everyone to start using VPN
services.’[^12BaumannSweden_22] In Sweden, the EU Data Retention Directive was never
applied to VPN providers under the local implementation of the law.
Therefore, by providing their customers with a free VPN service Bahnhof
managed to find a loophole that enables the company to comply with EU
and local law, and assure the privacy of their customers at the same
time.

## Anonine

VPN services make highly effective tools for hiding the identity of
Internet users. In Sweden, they predominantly act as efficient, and most
importantly, legal, vehicles for circumventing politically motivated
data retention practices. It is primarily thanks to the legal status of
VPN services that Sweden has emerged as a home to a number of local VPN
providers. One particularly successful example is Anonine, a Swedish
premium VPN provider established in 2009. Anonine started out as a niche
service, offering both Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) and
OpenVPN solutions through a handful of servers based in Sweden. In
recent years, and certainly influenced by the implementation of the Data
Retention Directive in Sweden in early 2012, Anonine’s customer base
grew so large that the company had to expand its servers considerably.
Today, Anonine operates servers in more than a dozen international
locations, and ranks as one of the most popular VPN services in Sweden.

Given the uncertainty of many Swedish Internet users about the
collection of metadata, it is not surprising that privacy concerns turn
out to be the main driver for VPN usage in Sweden. On Flashback – the
biggest Swedish-speaking Internet forum with around one million
registered members – the six hundred or so threads dealing with VPN use
often revolve around privacy concerns. In the lengthy thread dedicated
to Anonine, one user responds to a question about the level of security
provided by Anonine’s different VPN solutions as follows:

> Well, in general PPTP is better than using nothing. However, if you
> are very serious about your security you should only use an OpenVPN
> solution with good encryption. I do use PPTP, but only if I want to
> protect myself from my ISP or the idiots at Wayne’s Coffee \[a Swedish
> coffee house chain\]. If there is a bigger threat, then I turn to
> OpenVPN.[^12BaumannSweden_23]

Here, the use of a VPN service is justified out of fear that someone’s
Internet activity could become uncovered—with anyone, from customers in
a coffee shop, to an Internet service provider, or even bigger threats
(possibly the government?), a potential security risk.

Anonine is all too aware of the privacy concerns of its customers. The
company’s website is a gray and somewhat generic looking home page
listing some of the key features of the service (Fig. 1). It is not
until we look at the top right corner of the page that we notice a
bright red button warning us: ‘You are not anonymous!’ Speaking directly
at us, the Internet users, the site makes a point of highlighting the
danger of our behavior, namely surfing the web carelessly without the
security only a VPN service can provide. Upon further inspection of
Anonine’s web presence, we notice that the first page alone makes
mention of the word ‘anonymous’ five times (not counting the company’s
name, which is a wordplay on *anonym*, the Swedish version of
*anonymous*), in addition to multiple uses of related terms like ‘safe’
or ‘secure.’ This, of course, is hardly a coincidence.

![Figure 1 The website of Anonine, a popular Swedish VPN provider.](imgs/BaumannImage1.png)
*Figure 1 The website of Anonine, a popular Swedish VPN provider.*

Another reason for Anonine’s popularity among Swedish Internet users is
the company’s “local” brand. Swedes tend to be loyal to homegrown
services, as evident by the immense popularity of Spotify and Swefilmer,
and Anonine proves that even in the competitive VPN field marketing a
product as a local alternative can prove beneficial. Despite being
registered in the Seychelles, Anonine very much feels like a local
service with a website available in Swedish and English, and customer
support provided in both languages. Furthermore, the service offers its
clients to use local payment options, such as Payson (a Swedish
alternative to PayPal) and Cellsynt (mobile payment via SMS and
telephone), in addition to the more conventional credit card options.
These might seem like small touches to some, but to a dedicated
community of technology-savvy Swedish Internet users discussing the ins
and outs of different VPN services on an online forum, they can make all
the difference.

## Conclusion

Sweden is one of the most convenient places to stream online video. The
country’s media landscape is host to a plethora of streaming platforms,
offering viewers a sumptuous mix of local and offshore, free and
premium, as well as authorized and unauthorized alternatives. Further,
thanks to one of the best ICT infrastructures in the world, high-profile
players like Netflix and Time Warner (HBO) have been drawn to the small
Scandinavian country, making available a considerable amount of premium
content. At the same time, viewers who either do not want or cannot pay
for this kind of content have the possibility to use gray video
streaming platforms like Swefilmer, which despite providing free access
to pirated copies of thousands of movies and television shows can be
used legally.

Given this overprovision of local and offshore video streaming
alternatives, geoblocking does not impact the online viewing experience
in Sweden noticeably. Yet, much like in many of the countries studied in
this book, circumvention tools are an important aspect of online
culture. VPN services, which in other countries might be used for
geoblocking circumvention purposes, are important tools for Swedish
Internet users to bypass government data retention. There are reports of
Sweden being implicated in mass surveillance practices, based on
documents provided by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden in the summer
of 2013.[^12BaumannSweden_24] Consequently, privacy remains high on the agenda for many
Internet users who have become accustomed to a country famed for its
libertarian digital politics. Companies providing VPN services like
Anonine surely will not complain about Swedish Internet users’ quest for
privacy.
