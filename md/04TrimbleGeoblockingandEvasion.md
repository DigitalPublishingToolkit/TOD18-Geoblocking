# Geoblocking, Technical Standards and the Law

###Marketa Trimble###

## Introduction
In a world where countries cannot agree on a single set of laws that
would apply uniformly around the globe, most national laws need to be
territorially confined. Without territorial limits, laws have
extraterritorial effects that often, although not always, impinge upon
other countries’ sovereignty and freedom to set their own laws and
policies. For example, what might work as law in the United States might
not work in France, and therefore French law might be different from
U.S. law. Some legal rights and responsibilities exist only within
countries’ jurisdictional limits, and therefore persons and entities may
enjoy the rights and must fulfill the responsibilities within the
defined territory. For example, copyright is territorially limited;
someone who owns copyright to a work in the United States under U.S. law
might not be the owner of copyright to that same work in France under
French law.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_1] As long as the world operates on the basis of national
laws, there will be a need to replicate national borders on the internet
to comply with these corresponding physical limitations.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_2] Geoblocking
is being used with increasing frequency to achieve this compliance.<span
id="_Ref427221223" class="anchor"></span>[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_3]

The relationship between geoblocking and legal compliance has undergone
significant development in recent years. Legislators, courts, and
agencies previously did not view geoblocking as a reliable method of
achieving legal compliance. They assumed that the internet was
inherently borderless and geoblocking was invariably unreliable, and
they adopted laws, rendered judgments, and issued decisions with the
conviction that these would inevitably have global effects.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_4]
Recently, however, legislators, courts, and agencies have begun to
consider geoblocking as a viable tool for delineating the effects of
their laws, judgments, and decisions, and for territorially limiting
actions on the internet in general.

The idea that geoblocking could be used as a compliance tool is one part
of the development of the relationship between geoblocking and legal
compliance. This chapter outlines the three stages through which this
development will proceed. In the first stage, geoblocking will be
accepted as a tool of regulation and enforcement. While acceptance has
already occurred in some countries in some contexts, this acceptance is
certainly not yet general or widespread. In the second stage, minimum
standards for geoblocking will be promulgated because the use of
geoblocking for purposes of legal compliance necessarily calls for
minimum technological standards that geoblocking tools must meet in
order to create virtual borders sufficiently precise and impermeable to
satisfy the law. In the third stage, circumvention of geoblocking and
the tools that facilitate circumvention will be targeted by countries’
regulation. The three stages will likely begin at different times in
different countries, industries, and contexts, but will eventually
overlap and thereafter develop concurrently.

## Geoblocking as a Tool of Regulation and Enforcement

The first stage of the development of the relationship between
geoblocking and legal compliance – the process of accepting geoblocking
as a tool of regulation and enforcement – is already under way. Here,
three specific developments are notable: First, private party contracts
are including geoblocking to secure territorial limitations on
contractual obligations; second, regulators have turned to geoblocking
as their preferred means of achieving compliance with
territorially-limited regulatory requirements; and, third (the most
remarkable development so far), the legal profession is exploring the
potential for geoblocking as the *only* valid means to comply with laws
that create territorially-limited rights and responsibilities. We now
look at these developments in detail.

Parties enter contracts that include obligations to geoblock for various
reasons, not all of which are based in legal requirements.<span
id="_Ref427151833" class="anchor"></span>[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_5] Geoblocking may be used to
customize localized services through supply of content in a particular
language, culturally-sensitive content, and localized advertising.
Geoblocking may be also used to enforce price differentiation in various
markets. Contractually-prescribed geoblocking need not follow national
borders; parties may define other, completely different territorial
limits if they wish – such as only the West Coast of the United States,
or the Flemish-speaking region of Belgium. Additionally, parties include
geoblocking in their contracts in order to comply with obligations
related to territorial limitations arising by law. For example, when a
content provider owns copyright to content in only some countries and
licenses that content only for some of the countries in which it owns
copyright, its license may require that the licensee geoblock users who
connect from outside the particular countries for which the license is
issued. For instance, when Czech Television obtains a license from BBC
to the *Doc Martin* TV show, BBC might limit the license to the
territory of the Czech Republic with the result that the Czech
Television must use geoblocking to prevent users who connect from
outside the Czech Republic from viewing the show on their platform.

The acceptance of geoblocking as a tool of regulation is another
important development. For example, online gambling regulators in some
jurisdictions require their licensees to use geoblocking tools and to
allow users to access content only within the jurisdictions where online
gambling is legal. In Germany, when doubts arose as to whether
geoblocking was and is a sufficiently reliably tool to meet the
territorial limitations set by law for online gambling, courts have
confirmed that geoblocking is sufficiently reliable for that
purpose.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_6] In the United States, a Kentucky court issued an order
directing an online gambling website to geoblock users connecting from
Kentucky in order for the website to comply with Kentucky law.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_7]

As these two court decisions suggest, geoblocking may eventually be
recognized by courts as *the* indispensable compliance tool. This
development is important because it could result in geoblocking being
accepted as standard practice on the internet – the standard measure
that every actor on the internet would be expected to employ in order to
satisfy an obligation to territorially restrict access to content on the
internet.

Typically, the law expects persons and entities to employ measures that
are reasonable according to the law to comply with the law, including
its territorial limitations. An example of an offline distribution of a
book is illustrative: When a distributor obtains a license to sell
copies of a book in one particular country, the law requires the
distributor to take reasonable measures to comply with the territorial
limitation of the license. The distributor takes a reasonable measure,
for example, when it checks the address of a purchaser before it ships a
copy of the book to the purchaser. The law does not require the
distributor to attach a weight to every copy to make transportation of
the copies more difficult, nor does the law expect the distributor to
attach a radio frequency identification tag to every copy and install a
surveillance system to monitor the movement of each copy and prevent
copies from leaving the country. The latter two measures are technically
feasible but are clearly not reasonable; a contract could in theory bind
the publisher to employ such measures, provided that the publisher would
agree to such unusual contractual terms. However, absent such
contractual terms or absent an explicit requirement in the law, no one
would read in the law – for example in copyright law in the present
example – an obligation to employ such extreme measures.

Is geoblocking today more consistent with checking purchasers’ addresses
or is it more like attaching weights and radio frequency identification
tags to books? If geoblocking is more like checking purchasers’
addresses and is a reasonable measure, then any territorial limitations
mandated by law should implicate the required use of geoblocking. If
geoblocking is more like a weight or radio tag, it is not a reasonable
measure and will not usually be required by law. The following dispute
involving video content made available on the internet highlights the
issue that needs to be clarified.

A dispute arose between *Spanski Enterprises, Inc.*, a Canadian
television distributor, and *Telewizja Polska, S.A.*, a Polish
government-owned corporation that operates several television channels
in Poland. *Spanski Enterprises* obtained an exclusive license from
*Telewizja Polska* to broadcast Polish television programming in North
and South America; later the parties updated the license to include
broadcasting on the internet. However, approximately seven years into
the license, *Spanski Enterprises* objected to the fact that internet
users in North and South America could access the *Telewizja Polska*
website and watch content on the website for which *Spanski Enterprises*
held an exclusive license.

The first lawsuit that *Spanski Enterprises* filed (in 2007) resulted in
a 2009 settlement agreement in which the parties agreed to “maintain and
continue all Internet geo-blocking which is currently in effect, and
\[…\] use their best efforts to conform their respective future
geo-blocking efforts to the latest widely disseminated and financially
practicable geo-blocking technologies.”<span id="_Ref427140367"
class="anchor"></span>[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_8] Then, in 2012, *Spanski Enterprises* returned
to court with allegations that *Telewizja Polska* had “turned off the
geoblocking feature and thereby intentionally made available to viewers
in the United States via the Internet thousands of episodes of shows to
which \[*Spanski Enterprises*\] had the exclusive distribution rights in
the United States.”[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_9] As of September 2015 the case was still pending
before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia with the
trial date set for December 7, 2015.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_10]

If *Telewizja Polska* did indeed disable geoblocking (an allegation it
denied), it would likely violate the settlement agreement. The more
difficult question is whether *Telewizja Polska*’s alleged actions would
violate U.S. copyright law – whether the use of geoblocking is a
reasonable measure that the law today should expect to be employed by
content providers to avoid infringing the copyrights of others. *Spanski
Enterprises* claims that *Telewizja Polska* infringed copyright under
U.S. law; *Telewizja Polska* contends that its “obligation to geo-block
is a contractual covenant to protect the rights actually licensed to
\[*Spanski Enterprises*\] – it is not part of the licensed rights
themselves.”[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_11]

*Telewizja Polska* argues that an obligation to geoblock is a
contractual covenant. If *Spanski Enterprises* can prove its
allegations, a breach of a contractual covenant would result only in
monetary remedies for a violation of the agreement; a finding of
copyright infringement would presumably be more costly for *Telewizja
Polska*. The outcome of the case could be of general importance for the
future of geoblocking because it should clarify whether geoblocking is
*the* reasonable measure – *the* standard means that internet actors
must employ to meet territorial limitations on rights and
responsibilities imposed by law.

## Minimum Standards for Geoblocking

Minimum standards for geoblocking – the hallmark of the second stage of
the development in the relationship between geoblocking and legal
compliance – have been the subject of debate. A range of geoblocking
tools exists, and more advanced tools are constantly being
developed.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_12] The difficulty, of course, is setting minimal legal
standards with sufficient precision, while still allowing improvements
in current tools and the development of new tools. To facilitate and
propel improvements, minimum standards must not include specific
technical details that would entrench old technology; to safeguard the
potential to develop new technology, minimum standards should follow the
principle of technological neutrality.

As mentioned earlier, minimum standards for geoblocking exist in
contracts between parties that have agreed to the use of geoblocking.
For example, the language of the 2009 settlement agreement between
*Spanski Enterprises* and *Telewizja Polska* sets a minimum standard for
geoblocking; the parties agreed to “the latest widely disseminated and
financially practicable geo-blocking technologies.”[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_13] In a licensing
agreement concluded between Sony and Netflix, the parties agreed on very
general language according to which Netflix would “utilize an industry
standard geolocation service”[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_14] and language that specified that the
geolocation service employed must, for example, “provide geographic
location information based on DNS registrations, WHOIS databases and
Internet subnet mapping” and “provide geolocation bypass detection
technology designed to detect IP addresses located in the Territory, but
being used by Registered Users outside the Territory.”[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_15] For the
purposes of legal compliance, courts and regulators will play an
important role in defining the minimum standards of geoblocking.

The general understanding is that geoblocking cannot be perfect;
geoblocking tools are not 100 percent reliable, particularly given that
users have access to readily available tools to circumvent
geoblocking.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_16] For example, users can use VPNs, such as Chameleon,
simpler tools, such as MyExpatNetwork, or more complicated tools, such
as Tor, to bypass geoblocking and access content on the internet that is
otherwise inaccessible to them because of their location. Not only might
it be unrealistic to expect perfect geoblocking, it might also be
illogical to require perfect geoblocking for purposes of legal
compliance. The offline physical borders on which legal compliance
relies are not impermeable, and the law accepts some cross-border
spillover. For example, countries recognize an intellectual property law
exception for small quantities of materials protected by intellectual
property rights that travelers carry in their luggage for personal
use.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_17] Similarly, some leakage through national borders on the
internet should be acceptable. The question is what an acceptable volume
of leakage is; the acceptable volume may vary depending on the area of
law and regulation. In other words, when does VPN or proxy use become
too much?

The fact that geoblocking circumvention tools exist does not mean that
geoblocking is incapable of meeting some minimum standards of
territorial restrictions sufficient for legal compliance. The approaches
that courts have taken to evaluate the effectiveness of technological
protection measures designed to protect access to copyrighted works is
instructive, given that, in the case of technological protection
measures, tools also exist that enable circumvention of these measures.
For example, the Regional Court of Munich, in a discussion of the
secondary liability of an online journal provider for providing a link
to a circumvention tool, noted that the ineffectiveness of a
technological measure cannot be concluded from the existence of a
circumvention tool; it might be sufficient for the measure to prevent
*average* users from accessing protected content.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_18] The U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California rejected an argument
proposing that a measure not be considered effective if tools to
circumvent the measure are “widely available on the Internet.”[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_19] The
court said that the argument is “equivalent to a claim that, since it is
easy to find skeleton keys on the black market, a deadbolt is not an
effective lock to a door.”[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_20]

## Regulating the Circumvention of Geoblocking

In the third stage of the process, the law will start to respond to the
easy availability of VPNs, proxies and other circumvention tools. Their
widespread use, as shown throughout this book, suggests that ongoing
evasions can no longer be considered negligible spillover.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_21] Some
content providers now include provisions in their terms of service that
prohibit internet users from evading geoblocking. For example, German
television station *Sat.1* in its terms of service for the use of its
online video portal makes it a violation of the terms of service for
users to “alter, evade or otherwise disregard” the technical measures
that the station uses to territorially limit the access to content on
the portal.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_22] If a user does use a VPN or other tool to circumvent
geoblocking, the user violates this provision of the terms of service
and is in breach of his contract with *Sat.1*, thus exposing himself to
a response by *Sat.1*, who may terminate the contract with the user, or,
although unlikely, file suit against the user for violation of the
contract.

Absent a contractual provision prohibiting circumvention, the status of
geoblocking evasion under the law of various countries is currently
unclear.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_23] Specific legislation on the evasion of geoblocking does
not exist; whether the evasion of geoblocking is covered by copyright
law provisions on technological protection measures or retransmission
has been disputed,[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_24] and anti-computer-hacking laws may be applicable
in some countries, to a limited degree.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_25] In some countries the
providers of geoblocking circumvention tools could be held liable for
facilitating access to restricted content.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_26] A dispute that arose in
New Zealand between the media companies SKY, TVNZ, Lightbox, and
MediaWorks on one side and ByPass Network Services on the other side
seemed to have provided impetus for a clarification – or at least a
fruitful discussion – of the status of circumvention of geoblocking in
New Zealand.<span id="_Ref427225220" class="anchor"></span>[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_27] The
dispute over the Bypass *GlobalMode* product – a “geo-unblocking
solution” for ISPs – was settled in June 2015 and therefore provided no
guidance on the status of the evasion of geoblocking in New Zealand;
nevertheless, it is notable that the practical result was the promise to
withdraw the geoblocking circumvention tool from the New Zealand market
as of 1 September 2015.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_28]

The development of approaches to geoblocking circumvention tools by
legislators, courts, and agencies has been complicated by the fact that
many existing circumvention tools were developed for and still serve
another purpose – anonymization. Safeguarding privacy, protecting
personal data, and securing the freedom of speech and the right to
access information are among the concerns that suggest that a simple
proscription against geoblocking circumvention tools might be
undesirable.

## Conclusion

In discussing the three stages in the development of the relationship
between geoblocking and legal compliance this chapter presumes that
geoblocking will be more pervasive and eventually become the only means
to achieve legal compliance, including compliance with territorial
limitations of the law. The presumption is rooted in the conviction that
legal compliance on the internet cannot be achieved without replicating
national borders online. A single global law that would eliminate the
need for national borders is unlikely to develop anytime soon, and the
alternative – the harmonization of national laws – is unlikely to result
in the uniformity necessary to make national borders obsolete for legal
purposes. Because differences among national laws persist, a need for
borders on the internet, and therefore for geoblocking, seems
unavoidable.

There is, of course, much opposition to geoblocking. Users complain
about the inaccessibility of geoblocked content, and their increasing
use of geoblocking circumvention tools evidences their displeasure with
territorial limitations. In May 2015 the European Commission criticized
the use of geoblocking in the European Union in ‘A Digital Single Market
Strategy for Europe – Analysis and Evidence’<span id="_Ref427226427"
class="anchor"></span>[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_29] and launched a related inquiry into the
e-commerce sector.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_30] In the document the Commission referred to
geoblocking as one of the “barriers that hold back cross-border
e-commerce.”[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_31] A preference for unencumbered cross-border access to
content on the internet is also apparent from the draft ‘Trade in
Services Agreement’[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_32] that is being negotiated by a group of
countries – members of the World Trade Organization. However, all
official initiatives throughout the world concerning cross-border access
on the internet recognize that there are areas of law – such as
intellectual property law and gambling law – in which countries will
continue to have legitimate grounds for imposing restrictions on the
cross-border flows of goods and services.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_33] Although some
stakeholders desire a liberalization of cross-border access to internet
content, the fact cannot be ignored that countries have major
differences in some areas of law, and therefore good reasons to maintain
control of content flows.

Business models that respond to consumer demand for cross-border access
will continue to emerge, and countries can facilitate the development of
new business models by providing favorable legislative and regulatory
environments. The 2014 European Union’s Collective Rights Management
Directive[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_34] is one effort to improve the environment for businesses
that seek to provide cross-border online access to music, at least
within the borders of the European Union. Because some geoblocking is
required by law, contracts will not be able to eliminate geoblocking
entirely; however, contracting parties can eliminate some geoblocking,
and limited geoblocking evasion could mitigate some of the effects of
geoblocking where the use of geoblocking exceeds what is required by
law. For example, a system of “digital passports” could facilitate
access to users who travel abroad.[^04TrimbleGeoblockingandEvasion_35]
