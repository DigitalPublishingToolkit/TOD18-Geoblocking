# Periscope, Live-Streaming and Mobile Video Culture

###Adam Rugg and Benjamin Burroughs[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_1]###

<span id="h.9mdc1zkz4t1f" class="anchor"></span>On 26 March 2015,
Twitter released Periscope, its recently acquired live-streaming mobile
app, on the Apple app store. Despite widespread praise and media
attention for the app’s potential to usher in the era of mobile
live-streaming, Periscope initially experienced slow uptake amongst
mobile users. However, within a few months of launch, the perils and
promise of Periscope were on full display as users found novel and
sometimes illegal ways of using the app. Perhaps the most infamous use
of Periscope occurred on 2 May 2015, during a much-hyped boxing match
between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. After thousands of users
used Periscope to watch unsanctioned streams - rather than pay an
unprecedented \$100 for the official PPV feed of the fight - *The New
York Times* observed that the app had ‘barged its way onto sports’
biggest stage’, while the CEO of Twitter controversially declared the
app the real winner of the night.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_2] While most discussion of Periscope
since then has focused on the app’s potential for piracy, we suggest it
also represents a broader, escalating tension between traditional media
industries, informal digital media practices, and mobile technologies.

Just three months later and across the world in Turkey, an unemployed
math teacher named Ekol Hoca was utilizing the app as an educational
tool to reach thousands of Turkish students. After the Turkish
government shut down prep schools affiliated with the Gülen religious
movement as part of a political crackdown, Hoca turned to Periscope to
continue the lessons the government sought to end.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_3] In so doing he
circumvented state authority and disrupted the strategic place of the
government through this emergent mobile technology. With around 1,500
students sometimes turning into his broadcasts, Hoca has shown how
live-streaming technologies can themselves be political tools, bypassing
state controls to communicate and interact with other citizens.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_4]

Elsewhere we have looked at the rise of ‘streaming culture’ and
competing claims of sanctioned and unsanctioned streaming media.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_5]
Operating across the formal and informal media economy,[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_6] Periscope is
a manifestation of these claims within a mobile context and a
demonstration of how streaming culture is increasingly entering into
wider public awareness and use. Periscope harnesses advances in
compression, hardware, and mobile bandwidth to surpass earlier
desktop-oriented live-streaming platforms like *Justin.tv*, which was
originally designed for streaming original content from a user’s
everyday life before becoming a space for pirated sports broadcasts.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_7]
Further, Twitter’s acquisition of Periscope (and the subsequent
integration of Periscope into the Twitter platform), has given the app a
significant edge in the US over mobile competitor Meerkat, which
launched shortly before Periscope. As of August 2015, Periscope had over
10 million users that were watching over 40 years of video per day.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_8]

As a mobile video sharing infrastructure based on the individual, yet
utilizing global smartphone platforms, Periscope challenges broadcast
logics of content production and circulation. The intimacy of the app,
combined with its immediacy, also fosters new types of live video
content, potentially reinvigorating mobile journalism and crisis
reporting. Ultimately, Periscope is the product of this complicated
duality. It is a platform for citizens to bypass state and corporate
control while simultaneously enmeshing users within the very production
processes of the digital media industries. In doing so, these nascent
streaming technologies reflect the interlocking discontinuities of the
evolving media landscape where traditional and digital media industries
continue to struggle over the future of video production and
circulation.

## Periscope, Locational Piracy, and the Circumvention of Media Institutions

Since its launch, Periscope has been linked to piracy. The app first
made news when people used it to live-stream the U.S. premiere of the
5<sup>th</sup> season of the HBO series *Game of Thrones,* allowing
non-subscribers and those living outside the U.S., where the program had
a later premiere date, to view the first episode for free. The incident
resulted in HBO labeling the app as a site for ‘mass copyright
infringement’ and lobbying for more ‘proactive’ tools to remove
copyrighted material from the platform and ‘not be solely reliant on
upon notifications’.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_9] Shortly afterward, the app hit the headlines
again during the aforementioned Mayweather-Pacquiao boxing match. HBO’s
calls have been echoed by many in the sports media industry as well,
namely the former chairman of NBC Sports, Dick Ebersol, who derided the
use of Periscope for live and televised sporting events as ‘theft’. ‘Are
you going to let them steal the signal?’, he asked.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_10]

While Periscope has quickly become a new platform for the old practice
of distributing copyrighted video, it has also given greater prominence
to a new form of copyright circumvention – the ‘on-site’ livestream.
Most acutely seen in the sports world, Periscope has quickly become a
controversial app for spectators and journalists alike. Golf reporter
Stephanie Wei had her PGA tour credentials revoked after using Periscope
to showcase golfers teeing off in practice. As Wei defended herself by
pointing out that the practice shots were not going to be televised, the
Tour’s chief marketing officer argued that the tour owns the rights to
all media produced in and around the event, adding that Wei was
‘stealing’.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_11] Following the PGA tour’s lead, the NHL, NFL, EPL, and
Wimbledon have all banned the use of Periscope from stadiums. Outside of
sports, Comic-Con, the largest popular culture convention in the world,
also instituted a Periscope ban for its 2015 gathering. Key players on
the film festival circuit are similarly wary. While Cannes Film Festival
already bans any form of video recording inside the festival, Mark Gill,
the president of Millennium Films, has declared the app, ‘a whole new
brand of terrifying’ as organizers have promised extra vigilance to
prevent any live-streaming of any films shown at the festival.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_12]
These emphatic statements and actions illustrate the expanding ability
of networked individuals to not only redistribute copyrighted content
from their television screens, but straight from the source as
well.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_13]

In 2007, Viacom waged a long legal battle against YouTube, seeking
damages for profiting off of the viewing of infringing content. The
Second Circuit court ruled that YouTube was indeed protected by the safe
harbor provision because the ‘DMCA requires knowledge or awareness of
specific infringing activity in order to find a party liable for
hosting [...] the district court found that YouTube was protected by the
safe harbor provision’.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_14] However, to bolster their legal positioning
and dissuade other lawsuits YouTube started filtering videos and posting
takedown notices. In the case of Periscope the safe harbor provision
largely protects Twitter as a corporate parent and hosting platform from
any legal liability (part of the reason Twitter’s CEO could be so brazen
in declaring Periscope the winner of the Mayweather/Pacquiao fight
despite rampant piracy and rights infringement). Thus, Periscope is free
to publicly decry streaming piracy on its platform while continuing to
reap the piratical benefits of its users streaming concerts, television
programs, sporting events, and conferences. However, when everyone with
a smartphone can potentially become a spontaneous distributor of
copyrighted material, the existing convention of ‘taking down’
infringing streams or posts after they are detected will increasingly be
less effective, resulting in greater calls from content owners for
modifying app policies and practices in order to address the
exponentially increasing difficulty of preventing copyright
infringement.

Periscope is also emerging as a circumvention tool for citizen
journalism and civic streaming. Civic streaming is a form of digital
witnessing that bypasses traditional media restraints, which lock down
the place and location of reporting. Periscope has quickly become a tool
for journalists to bypass traditional media industry infrastructure and
connect directly with audiences. Journalists routinely host Periscope
sessions where they answer audience questions and display their
expertise on current issues. In an era of social media, live-streaming
becomes a part of journalists building their own personal brands to
navigate post-Fordist labour markets. Journalists are extending the
workplace as new technologies facilitate greater audience connection,
but this, in turn, leads to increased audience expectations of seemingly
omnipresent reporting. Journalists are required to tweet and be ‘live’
as Periscope augments the demands of immediacy. There is no excuse not
to be constantly broadcasting. The audience as a group of networked
individuals spurs the need for an active, temporal, always-already
connected coverage.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_15]

On March 26th, the same day as Periscope’s initial unveiling to the
public, a large downtown fire in Manhattan, New York caused a discussion
about the implications of live-streaming on citizen journalism and
crisis reporting. Predictability, the ability to almost instantaneously
broadcast and view the unfolding of a crisis was heralded as a ‘new form
of ubiquitous live broadcasting’, with one observer suggesting that
‘(w)ith the smartphones in our pockets, we’re all citizen journalists
now’.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_16] Certainly this ubiquity and immediacy enable new forms of
participation as citizens broadcast the spectacular as an emergent form
of crisis reporting. However, this spectacle of distant suffering as
civic streaming presents a complicated duality, on the one hand enabling
participation and immediacy while on the other generating proximity at a
distance, intensifying a kind of voyeurism.

Civic streaming is also a circumvention of the information control of
the state and media institutions. An increased sense of proximity means
that the viewing public feels like they can be present amidst a crisis,
natural disaster, or riot. Periscope is circumventing state and
traditional media structures of power that filtered audiences’ proximity
to scenes of tragedy. Citizens live-streaming are no longer wholly
reliant on news organizations to disseminate stories and broadcast
dissenting viewpoints and values. This is especially important within
communities that have a longstanding distrust of government surveillance
and control from law enforcement officers. Increased usage of smartphone
technology to film police officers in a string of incidents that depict
questionable police behavior have served to ignite a national debate in
the United States about the role of body cameras, cellular technology,
and live-streaming. Paradoxically, live-streaming increases the capacity
of state and local governments to ramp up surveillance of citizens,
while still allowing for citizen journalism through the same tools.
Streaming and increased surveillance can lead to surveilling the
surveillers.

## The Future of Live-Streaming Apps: Assimilation, Regulation, and Geoblocking

Our discussion of Periscope-enabled circumvention and civic streaming
exemplify the unique possibilities of mobile live streaming and reveal
the competing discontinuities of emergent mobile video culture. Further,
they illustrate the increasing divergence of the mobile video space from
existing broadcast and desktop platforms. Within the realm of desktop
access to internet video, distribution has historically been modeled
according to existing television broadcast logics that divide control of
content by nation and enforce those divisions through the use of
geofences. Even platforms with large amounts of amateur content have
instituted geographic restrictions on content, as in the case of YouTube
and its Content ID system. However, recent popular mobile video sharing
platforms have been much more global in nature. Instagram, Vine and
Periscope (along with other popular live-streaming apps such as Meerkat
and Twitcast) are conceptualized as geographically agnostic in terms of
content rights, with no current tools for geographical restrictions in
place. Perhaps owing to the premise and promise of mobile computing, the
use of geofencing within mobile apps is often utilized as an inclusive,
positive measure rather than one of restriction, such as in the use of
location based games, proximity-based alerts and notifications, and in
the functioning of location-dependent service apps like Uber.

While there are plenty of websites and desktop-oriented video platforms
that are global in nature, the ubiquity of mobile devices along with the
prominence of these smartphone apps is the crucial difference. With 70
percent of the world’s population predicted to own a smartphone by 2020,
and the accelerating expansion of mobile bandwidth across the world,
Periscope’s infamous rise to fame during the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight
and *Game of Thrones* premiere, then, is less a surprise than it is a
culmination of the increasing migration of producers and consumers to
mobile video platforms.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_17] Vine, another Twitter-owned platform for
the sharing of six-second video clips, has also received major criticism
from content owners, especially the English Premier League which has
sought to stop the proliferation of goal highlights that spread across
the platform seconds after they appear on television.

Periscope, and similar live-streaming smartphone apps, exist at the
forefront of mobile video culture and expand the ways that technology
and physical space interact. Whether through original content,
authorized and unauthorized behind-the-scenes moments, news reporting,
or the distribution of copyrighted material, live-streaming apps have
come to bypass many governmental, corporate, geographic, and technical
restrictions on producing and distributing live video. While Periscope
and other live-streaming platforms display how global networks of
individuals with media producing and distributing devices in their
pockets can disrupt the geographical and technological logics of
broadcasting, journalism, and piracy, it ultimately remains to be seen
how the media industries, national governments, and the cultures around
the world will adapt and respond to these disruptions. On the one hand,
Periscope is frequently heralded as opening new doors for global
communication and content sharing, but it is unlikely these doors of
rupture will stay open forever. Despite the positioning of the app as a
global video sharing platform, legal and corporate pressure may
potentially force the app to succumb to geographically based
restrictions that have long been in place for other live broadcasters.

As new media industries continue to mature, they will increasingly
integrate with old media industries, establish partnerships with content
providers, and participate in the structures of global capital and
financing. As such, the policies and purpose of popular live-streaming
apps will increasingly be beholden to pressures from content providers,
investors, and parent companies. While Periscope has not yet gestured
toward implementing any geofencing or copyright detection methods, it
may find itself in this position sooner rather than later. Already, its
parent company Twitter began partnering with major video content
providers under its Twitter Amplify program that launched in May
2013.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_18] Included in these partnerships is the NFL and PGA, which
already have a contentious relationship with Periscope, banning the app
from their respective live events.

As seen by HBO’s quick demand for more proactive tools to combat piracy
on the platform, large corporations are already placing pressure on
Periscope to not only eliminate copyright circumvention after it
happens, but provide prevention tools as well. Vine’s trouble in purging
soccer goal videos illustrates the difficulty in preventing the
proliferation of television content on social media platforms. However,
Periscope could still utilize geofences in order to prevent unauthorized
broadcasts of events at physical locations, such as sport stadiums, film
festivals, and concerts.

A model for this voluntarily geographic restricting already exists in
mobile social media application Yik Yak. The app, which allows users
within the same geographic area to post public messages, faced a public
backlash after elementary and high school students used the app to
anonymously cyber-bully other students. Eventually, Yik Yak partnered
with Maponics, a mapping company, to institute geofences around all
schools below college level to restrict younger students from using the
app at school.

Legal pressures may also force live-streaming apps such as Periscope to
install government-mandated geofences around ‘sensitive’ or ‘secure’
areas. As Cristina Alaimo and Jannis Kallinikos argue, social media is
‘actively involved in the production of new types of data that have
commonly remained outsid the regulative purview of institutions’.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_19]
Live-streaming is no exception. The quick proliferation of smartphones
across the world combined with rapid technological advances in phone
hardware and mobile bandwidth capacity have brought about a recent
expansion of live-streaming video within social networks, both existing
(in the case of the recently introduced Facebook Live feature) and new
(such as Periscope and Meerkat). The short period of time in which this
happened has made many live-streaming apps solely responsible to broadly
applied copyright laws and their own internal policies.

As Marketa Trimble states, many governments across the world have just
started grappling with the physical and digital mobility of internet
users and are still early in the process of figuring out how to
legislate and regulate the concept of geographical territories and
borders within the constructed geography of the front facing
internet.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_20] While many apps and techniques currently take advantage
of this legal grey area to bypass geofences and other restrictions,
governments and regulatory bodies could pass laws or restrictions that
give greater weight to territorial boundaries on the internet and
establish mechanisms for authorizing temporary and permanent geofences
that restrict the use of media-sharing platforms in certain locations.
Recent patents developed by Apple already point toward the technological
means these restrictions could be enforced.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_21]

We have already seen nation-states show a willingness to restrict
internet platforms that spur communication outside of official channels.
China and North Korea already block or heavily restrict a wide swath of
social media apps at the national level. Moments of crisis have also
prompted other nation-states to temporarily restrict social media apps
as well, most notably during the Arab Spring uprisings that began in
2010.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_22] During the uprisings, Twitter and Facebook became central
conduits for the organizing of protest actions, the proliferation of
revolutionary ideas, and communication with international sympathizers,
leading Tunisia, Egypt, and other Middle Eastern countries to restrict
citizen access to the social networks or even the internet as a
whole.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_23] While the efforts of these countries to install geofences
around Twitter and Facebook were partially subverted by the use of VPNs
and the digital attacks of the hacker group Anonymous, they starkly
revealed the importance of social media apps in conflicts between states
and their citizens.[^05RuggBurroughsPeriscope_24] As live-streaming continues to enmesh itself
within the structures of social media platforms and as civic streaming
increasingly becomes an important tool to communicate and share
information in times of crisis, it was will be subject to increased
efforts by states to restrict and control its use.

Periscope is just one of a suite of emerging technologies used to
circumvent copyright, access, and distribution restrictions. All of
these technologies contain user-friendly interfaces, branding, and
marketing efforts that reject the technical difficulty of previous
circumvention technologies to position themselves instead as
user-friendly computing tools. Some of these technologies, like VPNs,
DNS proxies, and IP maskers, utilize the geographical ambiguity of the
internet to bypass geofences and access content authorized to users in
different locales. Others, such as Periscope, Ustream, and Vine, provide
mobile users with live video publishing tools, allowing them to become
hosts of original and copyrighted content that can be streamed across
geographically agnostic platforms. All of these tools, however, reflect
the tension emerging as digital platforms make the production,
consumption, and distribution of video content exponentially easier for
corporations and consumers alike.
