#Tunnelling Media: Geoblocking and Online Border Resistance

###Juan Llamas-Rodriguez###

The highway functioned as an early metaphor for the increasingly
transnational network we now call the internet. The ‘information
superhighway’ promised interconnectivity that was faster and freer than
anything the world had seen before. In the decades since this initial
euphoria, the infrastructural metaphor for the internet has morphed into
variants like pipelines, tubes, and rhizomes, language that contests and
recalibrates what types of access and communication are possible.
Despite some residual techno-utopianism, the promise of a free network
of connectivity has turned out to be anything but in the midst of net
neutrality debates across the world. The internet is now a site for
struggles over sovereignty, surveillance, and control, concerns that
were once the domain of the offline world (or at least *imagined* as
such).[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_1] The web's fall from grace is mirrored in the metaphors used
to describe it. It is hardly surprising that the creators of Tor, an
online browser that allows for anonymous browsing in various websites,
liken their work to a ‘series of virtual tunnels’. As the power
struggles of the offline sphere become increasingly salient in the
online one, an alternative language that counteracts this dominant sense
of control has begun to coalesce. The metaphorical shift in the cultural
imaginary from a highway to a tunnel illustrates the death of that
initial fantasy of free, unfettered connectivity.

Metaphors are powerful means for understanding social life. Spatial
metaphors in particular proliferate across social theory and cultural
criticism, often without appropriate examination of their
implications.[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_2] Yet the tunnel metaphor invoked by the creators of
Tor, as well as consumer-friendly VPNs such as TunnelBear, is
instructive to think through the practices that circumvent ‘geofences’
since it likens these practices to the underground tunnels that allow
for bypassing borders in the physical realm. Surely there are many other
ways to describe alternative modes of online connectivity, but tunneling
is significant for a number of reasons. First, it alludes to a symbolic
vertical differentiation between channels of connectivity – these ‘dark
tunnels’ are not in some online elsewhere but they remain just below the
channels used for everyday navigating. As well, this vertical
differentiation reveals a struggle for legitimacy, where only accepted
channels are deemed (metaphorically) ‘above ground’. Vertical metaphors
for operations of power are all too common, especially for those
subordinated. The symbolic and material creation of vertical spaces in
turn produces sites for exposing and contesting these relations.
Thinking of these divergent forms of network connectivity as tunneling
practices signals one such space of contestation.

The intellectual task is therefore to pursue the metaphorical
implications of tunneling practices in order to theorize emergent and
resistant configurations of online connectivity. In particular, it is to
follow the example of physical border tunnels as a blueprint for
understanding the discourses around, and the technological restraints
of, contemporary borders as well as the methods for circumventing them.
At stake is not a comparison between two purportedly distinct spaces of
human activity, but rather a consideration of the consequences of
bordering processes in each of these spaces. If the aim is to analyze
how geoblocking technologies shape the cultural and political
geographies of the internet – in other words, how they de- and
re-territorialize the online world, then analyzing the methods for de-
and re-territorializing physical boundaries prove a generative starting
point. Metaphor, as a conceptual vehicle, allows for profound affinities
and adjacencies to be uncovered without differences being lost. Since
the verticality of the virtual sphere remains more symbolic and less
material than that of the physical sphere, the allusion to tunneling
translates the lessons and complications of the physical practice of
tunneling into the virtual realm while foregrounding the key differences
between them.

In essence, tunneling reorganizes geographies of control for a stretch
of time. If geoblocks, like borders, function not to protect sovereignty
but to sort populations, to categorize users and provide content based
on these categories, then tunneling provides an opportunity for change.
Yet not all tunnelling is the same. Degrees of technological
sophistication for physical and virtual tunnelling create a hierarchy
between those that can ‘hack’ their way around a geofence and those that
need the help of others. These various levels of differentiation
constitute users in relation to their distinct experiences of the
internet. Tunneling thus responds to, and counteracts, the control
enacted through borders, the hierarchization performed through technical
expertise, and the power imbalances engendered through different user
experiences.

## Borders on/off the Internet

Newfound spaces have always replicated the structures of already
existing ones. Tracing the connections between a pre-World War II
conception of air space, a Cold War era conception of outer space, and a
contemporary one of cyberspace, James Hay argues that each subsequent
invention of a space was tied to a reinvention of the liberal ideals of
governmentality.[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_3] If the notion of air space was integral to
supporting national sovereignty, the advent of outer space was key to
formulating questions about the reach and rule of new communication
technologies with a global reach. Cyberspace extends these questions
once again, projecting a virtual arena in which to rethink national
dominance and power. In accounting for both the physical and digital
realms, scholars write about ‘living in two planes’[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_4] or the
production of a ‘doubling of place’,[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_5] but these analyses posit the
internet as a ‘vehicle of mobility’ allowing you to end up somewhere
else from where you physically start. Instead, VPNs – as well as other
sorts of tunneling technologies – change the place you start at, a
critical difference since the regulation of online activities begins at
the national level.[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_6] Yet ‘changing the place you start at’ is more
than a feature enacted by user-friendly VPNs that provide the option of
choosing a location and mask an IP address to make it happen. It is a
characteristic that speaks to the changing nature of borders writ large.

The proliferation of information and communication technologies (ICTs)
have increased the function of borders as regulatory mechanisms.
Immigration agencies and border checkpoints operate as trackers of
movement, differentially regulating access to specific spaces for
specific subjects.[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_7] Oscar Gandy refers to these practices as the
‘panoptic sort’, where complex surveillance systems collect swathes of
information in order to ‘coordinate and control \[individuals’\] access
to the goods and services that define life in modern capitalist
economy’.[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_8] Given the sorting of both physical and virtual borders,
Didier Bigo suggests a dynamic conception of borders where it is the
borders themselves that are on the move. Borders, as we experience them,
are ‘concretions of power struggles in a specific space \[that are\]
materialized within a territory’.[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_9] A dynamic conception of borders
also demands a reconsideration of the movement that occurs across these,
the channels that restrict this movement, and the tunneling practices
that enable new forms of mobility.

While ICTs make border sorting faster and more efficient, they also
‘*add* friction, barriers or logistical costs to the mobility and
everyday lives of those deemed by dominant states or service providers
to be risky, unprofitable, or undeserving of mobility’.[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_10] The fact
that both nation states and service providers are implicated in these
practices speaks not only to the outsourcing of sovereign control – the
border tracking technologies used by countries are often privately
developed – but also to the blurring of the distinction between risky
citizens and risky consumers. Populations that are deemed unprofitable
become tantamount to undeserving citizens. Worse, they might be deemed
dangerous to the idealized freedoms of circulation promised for other,
more deserving consumers. The discursive slippage of the ‘dark web’, for
instance, groups into this concept both those users trying to avoid
spying from commercial trackers and those specialized in providing
illegal services online.

Thus, despite the sensationalism over building towering fences at
national borders, these boundaries are predicated less on ‘fencing off’
the national territory than on regulating what can be allowed through at
any given time. Global video culture is indicative of this shift in
bordering practices. The DVD market that once divided the globe into
sections required specific production characteristics (DVDs with the
appropriate language options, special features, and artwork depending on
the region) and targeted infrastructures (DVD players that were
region-specific or multi-region). The current video streaming markets
depend on local differences only in the last instance. Because they
capitalize on existing internet infrastructure and on centralized data
servers for storing content, the differently coded regions of the world
are thus only distinguished when verifying an IP address. The virtual
data point replaces the physical line. Much like ICT-enabled, ‘remote
control’ borders that can ‘jump scale’ into transnational space and
‘touch down’ in various nodes across the globe,[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_11] in contemporary
online video culture, content travels across the world only to be sorted
at endpoints. IP addresses become virtual passports to be presented at
the border checkpoints represented by various kinds of online geoblocks.
It is within this context of disaggregated, data-driven borders that
tunneling practices thrive, capitalizing on existing infrastructures to
create an alternative world of connectivity.

## A World of Tunnels

Tunnels come in multiple forms. The US Department of Homeland Security
identifies at least three different types of underground border tunnels.
Rudimentary tunnels are small, shallow, often crudely constructed and
used only to travel only a short distance. These are usually detected
when they cause a sinkhole, or ground surface collapse. In December
2013, officers from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and
Homeland Security Investigations found one of these tunnels in the
backyard shed of a residence in Nogales, Arizona. It was a crude,
hand-dug tunnel, approximately 52 feet long and roughly two feet wide by
three feet tall, with some wood shoring.[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_12] In contrast to rudimentary
ones, sophisticated tunnels, also called ‘super tunnels’, are
elaborately constructed systems. They usually stretch more than 2,000
feet and may include shoring, ventilation, electricity, and rail
systems. In April 2014, one such tunnel was discovered inside Otay Mesa,
a neighborhood in southern San Diego.[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_13] The San Diego Tunnel Task
Force inspected a warehouse and discovered a small hole in the floor
that led to a 15-foot walkway which connected to a 68-foot vertical
shaft that dropped into the tunnel, one of the longest straight-down
drops the agency had ever seen. The tunnel itself was 600 yards long and
included a multi-tiered electric rail system and an array of ventilation
equipment. The exit point was sealed with material that made it seem
like it was painted concrete, and there was a half-ton winch pulley
system to hoist up goods up the vertical shaft.

The third type of tunnel is the interconnecting one, which is intended
to make use of existing subterranean infrastructure such as storm drains
or sewers. During a routine inspection of the city’s main storm drain
system, authorities in Nogales found a concrete access panel embedded in
the storm drain floor and discovered a tunnel when they removed the
panel. U.S. Border Patrol, in partnership with Mexican federal police,
inspected the unfinished tunnel and guessed it was intended to end
underneath a public parking lot a few miles north. The passageway was
almost 160 feet long and was roughly two feet wide by three feet tall.
In its wake, a water line, storm drain pipe and two fiber optic lines
were exposed.[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_14] These types of tunnels are suspected to proliferate
across the Mexico-US border, prompting the creation of a specialized
‘tunnel task forces’, but because they include existing storm drains and
sewers as parts of their structure, they have become the hardest type of
tunnel to detect and shut down.

The interconnecting tunnel best corresponds to the type of digital
practices that fall under ‘tunneling’ since the latter also use existing
infrastructure – in this case, that of the internet – to create
loopholes or roundabouts that allow for distinct avenues of
communication. Exploiting the existing infrastructure has advantages for
avoiding detection. Because they utilize storm drains and sewers, users
of interconnecting tunnels depend less on creating their own channels.
This reduced effort benefits tunnels users both because they take less
time to construct the tunnel and because they are less likely to be
found. There is no complete mapping of the existing sewage drains around
the Mexico-US border, a region that extends almost 2000 miles, so
authorities need to evaluate whether an underground construction is
legitimate on an individual basis. In addition, interconnecting tunnels
take advantage of the geological affordances of the border region. The
physical characteristics of the local soil, for instance, vary
tremendously across the southern US border. Any tunnel detection
technology would need to adapt to different levels of porosity and
texture, and tunnel task forces would have to map the variations in
types of soil across the entire area they wanted to surveil. These
features mean that standardizing border tunneling detection highly
costly and cumbersome, which explains why finding and shutting down
these tunnels has been a slow process focused on one tunnel at a
time.[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_15]![](media/image2.jpeg)

Tunneling online follows similar deflection techniques. Small-scale
exploits, such as ad-blocking plugins or DNS proxies, capitalize on the
technologically taxing methods of real-time, extensive tracking,
allowing for restrictions can be temporarily circumvented. As well, VPNs
function by harnessing the complex system of IP address allocation and
user privacy laws in order to protect their users, making user targeting
a case-by-case ordeal. Large-scale tunneling structures such as Silk
Road can further obfuscate entire networks of activity from the
surveilled channels of the internet. This level of complexity once meant
that only people with sophisticated technological expertise could bypass
existing geoblocks. Yet the rise of consumer-friendly VPNs has made this
type of circumvention more accessible. It has also made it more
trackable. The rise of “anti-piracy industries” such as P2P traffic
measurement and packet inspection businesses has depended on the
centralization of contravention methods.[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_16] In the past, prosecuting
any one user bypassing geoblocking measures was almost never
economically or practically feasible, except in cases of users with
strong influence on multiple networks or deemed high security threats.
Now, the proliferation of technologies for geoblocking circumvention
results both in an increase of users and of methods to track and surveil
these users. Although tunneling by using existing infrastructure has its
advantages, the very fact that tunneling depends on structures that are
already in place means that these tunnels, physical or virtual, are not
intrinsically emancipatory solutions but rather temporary alternatives
to dominant forms of control.

## Temporalities of Tunneling

It is this temporal aspect that provides the last zone of overlap
between physical border tunnels and virtual tunneling practices. Recall
that tunneling reorganizes geographies of control for a stretch of time.
If borders have become dynamic, as Didier Bigo argues, then tunneling
takes advantage of this fluctuation to allow for previously restricted
traffic flow – but only temporarily. The dynamism of borders does not
imply an imbalance: tunnelling creates new routes that are eventually
foreclosed again. The stretch of time that tunnels occupy thus becomes a
crucial aspect to their successful implementation. In the case of
physical tunnels, this ‘stretch of time’ acquires a double significance:
first, it refers to the span of time that the tunnel is active before it
is found and shut down; second, it alludes to the spatial stretch, that
is, to the time it takes to cross the tunnel. Tunnels are therefore
transitory both because they create conditions that enable fugitive
flows and because they exist for a reduced amount of time. In the case
of virtual tunnels, these two meanings of the ‘stretch of time’ of
tunneling are conflated. Here the time it takes to ‘cross the tunnel’ –
to transfer whatever communication was previously prevented by
geoblocking – is one and the same as the time that this tunneling
protocol is active.

Nowhere is this temporal correspondence better exemplified than in the
case of the consumer-friendly VPN TunnelBear. Promoted for its ease of
use, TunnelBear consists of a simple interface with two user inputs, a
dropdown menu to select the geographical location of the IP address
desired and a switch button to turn the application on or off. All the
user has to do is turn the knob ‘On’ and the VPN is activated. The
tunnel is active as the data transmission occurs and becomes inactive
once the user switches the knob ‘Off’. The simplification of this
protocol into an on/off knob metonymizes the temporal aspect of
tunneling: there is a beginning and an end, and this stretch of time is
finite and measurable. The second user input, the selection of IP
address location, represents the reorganization of geography intrinsic
to tunneling. It also evidences the fact that tunnels reorganize, rather
than alter, these political and cultural geographies. VPNs undermine but
do not undo practices of geoblocking. Similarly, physical tunnels bypass
borders but do not permanently erase these geopolitically enforced
boundaries. Acknowledging the ‘stretch of time’ that tunneling entails
means realizing that the structural imperatives that make tunneling
necessary remain in place, disturbed but not disrupted.

The temporality of tunneling shows the structures of power of the
internet beyond their spatial characteristics. It also reveals the
internet’s power-chronographies, Sarah Sharma’s conception for how time
is ‘worked on and differentially experienced at the intersections of
inequity’.[^02LlamasRodriguezTunnelingmedia_17] Time as lived experience is always political, argues
Sharma, because it is produced at the intersection of a range of social
differences and institutions. Tunneling exhibits not only how users
experience these power differentials based on their geographical
location but also how they constitute themselves in time. To some
extent, this is analogous to the temporalities that media industries
call ‘windowing’, schedules that release media at different times in
different formats and locations. But tunneling allows for the
multiplication of these temporalities. Affluent users can afford VPNs
that shorten the windows when they can watch content, and
technologically savvy users can access this content even faster than
mainstream users. When, and for how long, any user can view previously
geoblocked content is a consequence of their economic or cultural
capital. Tunneling therefore has implications for the cultural geography
*and* the cultural chronography of the internet.

Finally, the temporal aspect of virtual tunneling methods carries
implications for theorizing media objects themselves. Film, television,
and video are considered time-based media because of how they produce
structures of temporarily in our culture. Early accounts theorized how
these media captured and represented duration. Later, the time of
reception came into focus, particularly the disjointed and disorganized
forms of temporality enabled by the advent of digital technologies for
recording and storage. The rise of geoblocking and methods of
circumventing it add another layer of temporality to the consumption of
these time-based media. If in online spheres the time needed to
circumvent geoblocking mechanisms is often the time required for data
transmission, then running time becomes tunneling time. The
chronographies of power that differentially produce subjects become
projected on the moving image, shaping its reception and composing
hierarchies of audiences. Theorizing contemporary media will
increasingly necessitate accounting for this third temporality, the time
that geographies of control are reorganized for media reception to
occur.
