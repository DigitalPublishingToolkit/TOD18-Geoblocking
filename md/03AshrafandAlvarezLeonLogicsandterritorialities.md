#The Logics and Territorialities of Geoblocking
 
###Cameran Ashraf and Luis Felipe Alvarez León###

## Introduction

The internet is often represented as an open network threatened by the aberrations of internet censorship and control. However, its historical
development and architecture belie this binary model. The early split of the ARPANET by the U.S. Department of Defense into MILNET and ARPANET in order to protect sensitive military communications demonstrates that the
ability to close and control the internet was by design part of its very foundation. Indeed, few states would embrace the internet were there not
sufficient technical mechanisms to ensure an acceptable degree of management, surveillance, and control. In order to produce a better
understanding of the political dimensions of the internet, the binary
model of an open or closed system should be seen as part of a broader
range of geopolitical and geoeconomic logics espoused by states and
other actors, such as firms, who envision and construct the internet
through different territorial perspectives.

The purpose of this chapter is to examine the territorialities
associated with the internet through the lens of geoblocking.
Geoblocking, from this perspective, is a phenomenon that brings together
various actors, each with particular logics of action, and maps their
corresponding territorialities onto the internet. The geopolitical and
geoeconomic logics behind geoblocking and their resulting
territorialities will be illustrated by a comparative examination of
states and markets through two specific examples: state-sponsored
internet censorship and online video distribution markets. These two
perspectives reveal how geoblocking and its corresponding logics of
deployment produce a range of territorialities that transcend the
open/closed binary through which the internet is often understood.


## States
The international state system is predicated upon geographical concepts
which establish territorial states as distinct and discrete entities.
The state is free to act within its territory, which is demarcated by
borders, and its freedom to act within those borders is its sovereignty.
Territory, borders, and sovereignty are the geographical assumptions
underpinning the international state system. While these geographical
concepts manifest themselves in many familiar ways, such as passport
controls at airports or border fences, they need not be bound to the
explicitly physical domain of land. Indeed, they have been adapted
through airspace, territorial waters, and subterranean rights. The
development of the internet, however, represents a new space for states
to act and to reassert traditional notions of territory. For example,
early cyber-utopians such as John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, envisioned cyberspace as a radical space
where borders and states no longer mattered: “Governments of the
Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from
Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of
the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no
sovereignty where we gather.”[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_1] In cyberspace one could be something
radically different and no longer be constrained by any of the perceived
drawbacks of the physical world, such as physical appearance or
geography.

Contrary to this vision, states have engaged with cyberspace by adapting
the ideas of territory, borders, and sovereignty to this environment
through the development of internet censorship and control. This is a
view of the internet as an extension of existing territory in the new
informational space through the development of laws and technical
systems to territorialize cyberspace. In effect, many aspects of the
international state system became duplicated online, such that the
internet experienced from within one state could radically differ from
the internet experienced from another. Through utilizing internet
controls states are able to restrict the flow of information inside and
outside of their borders, regardless of political circumstances. In
cyberspace internet filtering is the primary way states assert their
geopolitical visions, which are founded on the principles of sovereignty
and borders. This is the “information curtain” first articulated by
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2010.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_2]

The rise of state internet controls and internet filtering has led many
scholars and critics to assert that the modern state has found renewed
vigor and life online.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_3] The libertarian and utopian visions
surrounding the birth of cyberspace have given way to a colder realism
whereby cyberspace as a prototypical global public sphere[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_4] or global
cyber commons[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_5] is becoming increasingly balkanized and segmented
geopolitically. Censorship implementation and circumvention are a major
and growing industry, worth at least \$1.2 billion dollars in 2012 and
including well-known corporations such as Cisco Systems and McAfee.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_6]

##Activity regulations

According to Jonathan Zittrain and John Palfrey, activity regulations
embody the many levels in which state territorialities are mapped onto
cyberspace. Rather than internet-specific laws, activity regulations
often stem from extensions of pre-existing restrictions on freedom of
speech or other media controls with the specific forms they take vary
depending on social and political factors. For example, some states,
such as Saudi Arabia or Iran, choose to enact content regulations to
restrict or forbid citizens from developing, consuming, or distributing
certain types of content. On the other hand, states may choose to
“relocate” content regulations by requiring internet service providers
(ISPs) to filter content on behalf of the state in order to get a
business license. Companies that do not filter on behalf of the state
may be subject to various liabilities and penalties until they are in
compliance. Finally, in states with pervasive surveillance regimes,
users may engage in self-monitoring as a form of self-censorship echoing
Foucault's panopticon whereby the user, company, ISP, or other user or
provider censors themselves or the content and internet access they
provide without prompting or intervention by the state. [^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_7] This is
often accompanied by a general level of surveillance and monitoring by
the state that facilitates self-monitoring and surveillance as a social
norm.

As with content classification, these filtering categories are not
necessarily demarcated clearly, nor are their existence mutually
exclusive. A state may implement some or all of these categories in
their own interpretation of how best to protect and create informational
sovereignty. In Iran, ISPs must obtain licenses, web hosting and mobile
data plans require home addresses and personal registration, and cyber
cafes must also register users while being under the threat of liability
or licensing requirements.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_8] In China the state includes its content
restrictions in domestic copyright laws, creating a sheen of legitimacy
and the appearance of working with international copyright norms while
regulating content domestically. [^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_9] Further, content restrictions may
not be aimed solely at an individual user; a university or other
organization may be held liable by a state for facilitating
objectionable activities online as evidenced by the numerous copyright
lawsuits filed by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)
against U.S. university students. While these activity regulations are
often enforced to preserve state sovereignty, they can exist at the
confluence of multiple logics. For example, the use of copyright by
industry groups and enforced by the state can simultaneously advance a
specific kind of market logic while also enacting state territoriality.

## Technical regulations

While activity regulations focus on *what* is controlled through the
process of internet blocking, technical regulations focus on the
instruments used to achieve this aim. Technical regulations and the
technical specifics of internet filtering are expansive and vast. They
can be grouped into four broad categories: in-line, DNS/domain
tampering, denial of service, and national cyberzones.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_10] Each
category approaches filtering from a different perspective and each has
unique structural advantages and disadvantages. For example, in moments
of political crisis the easiest method to intimidate and control
information flows can be to attempt a denial of service attack either
conventionally or through identifying weaknesses in an offending
server/website and bringing it down.

In-line filtering is comprised of two methods: proxy filtering and
TCP/IP filtering. Proxy filtering seeks to insert another server between
the user and the internet. Users access this server, which retrieves
content on behalf of the user. Doing so allows the proxy server to cache
content, increasing performance and speed for the end user while
allowing administrators to have detailed abilities to block specific
assets rather than entire domains.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_11] This approach limits the user's
ability to connect directly to the internet, ensuring that virtually all
content is localized within the territorial state, a technique used by
Syria after the Arab Spring uprising.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_12]

TCP/IP filtering is the most commonly known method of internet
filtering. Data packets are inspected for specific attributes (IP
address, domain name, service port number, etc.) and this is checked
against a defined block list, usually provided by the state. This level
of analysis can occur at a router level or require a deeper level of
inspection. Filtering at the router level will examine just the header
of the information packet –equivalent to the address on an envelope– and
block or allow that packet to continue to its destination. Examining the
content of the data packet –equivalent to opening the envelope and
reading its contents– requires more sophisticated technologies, called
Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), which is currently believed to be in use
in Iran.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_13]

In the DPI method of TCP/IP filtering, the data packets are checked not
only at the header level, but the actual content of the packet is
checked for prohibited content, search queries, words, or other
information. These are then checked against another list automatically
via algorithm, to determine whether the packet should continue to its
destination or be dropped or blocked. Depending on the sophistication of
the algorithm, the censor can capture or monitor a tremendous amount of
information at a highly granular level. This system can be used to not
only identify content, but to address specific signatures and patterns
in encrypted communications and block those packets, as evidenced by the
repeated blocking of the Tor circumvention and anonymity tool in
Iran.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_14]

Most websites and online content are accessed using domain names, such
as Google.com or UCLA.edu. In order to effectively translate the human
readable domain names into machine readable IP addresses, users must
access their ISP's DNS server when requesting a website. This process is
normally invisible to the user, but within a filtering regime the ISP's
DNS server is fed with a list of specific domain names that should be
blocked. When a user attempts to access a website in a filtering regime
with DNS tampering, they will be unable to see the page.

Domain modifications and tampering are the counterparts to DNS
tampering. DNS tampering works to block a user within a national
filtering regime from accessing specific content. However, users outside
of the territorial filtering regime are still able to access that
content. If, for example, a website located in the Sudan is reporting on
atrocities within the country, then users in the home country would be
unable to access the content, but international media, such as CNN or
the BBC, would still be able to do so. Domain modifications prevent this
by removing the DNS entry for the domain name from the national DNS
servers, which outside users access in order to retrieve a domain.

The final category, denial of service, involves a range of actions
undertaken by states to filter both domestically and internationally. It
includes distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, hacking,
surveillance, and content takedown. The central logic of the denial of
service category is that it uses cyber-attacks and infiltration to
remove or alter undesirable content, regardless of where it is located
geographically.

Content takedowns are a relatively new method of filtering which
reflects the explosion of user-generated content in the web. In this
method, states and citizen sympathizers or paid actors “flag” or report
objectionable content to content providers in the hopes of having the
offending content removed and the uploader banned.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_15] If, for example,
a protest video were uploaded to video sharing site YouTube, a content
takedown would see state-affiliated actors register accounts and report
the video to YouTube so that it would be removed automatically.

The previous examples impose the territoriality of states by actively
filtering, blocking or removing content, thus altering information
flows. Surveillance, on the other hand, employs social, political,
legal, and technical means to observe, collect, and classify information
from the general populace and other targets of interest to the state.
In-line filtering, especially through DPI, aids in surveillance as all
aspects of data packets can be examined and then routed for storage and
further investigation. Surveillance supports filtering because it acts
as a digital panopticon whereby users are uncertain if they are being
observed or monitored, and thus practice self-censorship of content for
fear of punishment or other sanction.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_16] Thus, surveillance as a
filtering method must be supported by social or legal consequences
otherwise it lacks ability to facilitate filtering.

Finally, the creation of national cyberzones marks an approach where
‘hard’ territoriality that mirrors the land boundaries of the state is
deployed through internet controls[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_17] to fence in flows of
information. This approach seeks to develop an internal or “national
internet” whereby users can only access information located within their
territorial borders by disconnecting from the broader internet and
relying on an exclusively domestic one. International connections still
exist, but are restricted to elites or those with other forms of
government approval. North Korea's Kwangmyong network is the oldest
example of a national cyberzone where users can only access websites and
resources located within North Korea and approved by state information
ministries.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_18] As with many of the blocking techniques previously
discussed, national cyberzones can also intersect state with market
logic by creating market spaces that are free from external competition,
thus producing conditions that favor specific (often state-backed)
actors.

Geographical concepts such as borders, territory, and sovereignty thus
have both technical and legal analogues that have supported and extended
their conceptual development, mutation, and maturation throughout human
history. The Treaty of Westphalia's principle of mutual recognition, for
instance, was dependent upon surveying technologies that could
accurately demarcate and communicate borders. Technology plays a
critical role for states in demarcating their limits and extents as well
as communicating and defending those extents. To achieve this, states
must combine activity regulation within their geographies with
demarcation of these geographies through technical regulation. In spite
of ethereal metaphors such as ‘the cloud’, the internet is a
tremendously territorial medium grounded in space with easily
identifiable packets, standardized national domain registrars,
transnational data transit agreements and configuration, and national or
sub-national networks (autonomous systems) whose deployment is the
foundation of the internet and the purview of states.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_19]

Cyberspace is increasingly territorialized by states through activity
and technical regulations. States see cyberspace as an extension of the
existing geographical status quo and have extended their legal and
technical domains to encompass this, while simultaneously beginning to
pursue international conventions in cyberspace. However, states are not
alone in mapping their territorialities onto cyberspace. Indeed, states
often see markets and firms as integral to efforts to normalize
territorialized cyberspace. Through the transactions of myriad actors,
markets deploy their own specific territorialities onto information
flows. While mostly guided by a profit-seeking logic, these
territorialities are constantly in dialogue, interaction, and sometimes
tension with those of the state. The following section discusses the
guiding logics of markets and their associated territorialities on the
internet, and in doing so demonstrates a non-state centric logic through
which geoblocking produces a broad range of territorialities which
transcend attempts to understand the internet through an open/closed
binary perspective.

## Markets

While states can control or record flows of information to preserve
their sovereignty and territorial power online, market actors pursue a
different type of territorialization: one that allows them to maximize
profit. Often this involves “locking information” through technical
means, such as Digital Rights Management technologies, in order to
target specific authorized spaces or devices. This means that the
territorialities of information markets can be determined by the extent
of market segmentation, distribution and enforcement of intellectual
property rights, or the compatibility of technical means with particular
digital goods.

In order to understand how market actors territorialize information,
this process has to be put into the broader context of governance
structures, such as regulatory frameworks. Intellectual property
regimes, for example, have become instrumental in creating informational
market spaces by limiting the distribution of content to specific
jurisdictions. However, while this enables copyright holders, such as
film studios, to secure revenue from distribution rights, it also
presents new challenges. One of these is the difficulty of ensuring that
only ‘legitimate’ content flows within the territorialized information
markets. In digital environments it is very difficult to eradicate
market-anomalous behavior such as piracy and file-sharing due to the low
costs of reproduction and distribution online.

Another challenge for the construction of territorialized markets across
digital information networks is the globalizing scale of information
flows. This requires technical and governance frameworks such as payment
systems and intellectual property protections to be coordinated across
time and space at transnational scales. This level of coordination has
made it more difficult to maintain a strategy long used by film
distributors: the windowed release of products according to geographic
region, and even by medium, such as theater and then home video. This
strategy was designed to “manage time and control speed through space so
as to minimize the threat posed by new technologies.”[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_20] Consistent
with the logic of market actors, the ultimate goal in this stepwise
control of information is to reach the highest possible price each
segmented market is capable of bearing.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_21]

The distribution potential of digital networks presents a paradox to
copyright holders and their efforts to map their particular
territorialities onto these environments. While they present platforms
for wider distribution and expanded markets, they also enable the
development of actors who operate outside the bounds of those markets.
Configured in fluid, decentralized assemblages such as P2P file-sharing
networks and user communities, these actors often have the ability to
circumvent the territorial and legal controls imposed by states and
copyright holders.

Operating beyond the bounds established by territorialized information
markets, another type of information represents a potential for
disruption to profit-maximization in markets. This is the spread of
information outside the markets (through channels such as media outlets
and social networks) *about* content circulating within those markets.
The dissemination of this information may create network effects outside
the markets that increase demand for content circulating inside them.
Since digital goods such as films or TV shows are subject to the
territorial limits of the market, but reviews, commentary and memes are
not, this creates a spatial mismatch between the supply and demand. This
means that some demand may not be satisfied by legal means outside of
the markets due to either lack of authorized distribution or prices
higher than most consumers will pay. As Shujen Wang points out, in the
case of films and entertainment media, this has created an instant
demand for pirated products.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_22]

This tension between market territorialization and increased demand
through digital networks *outside of the market* is an example of how
new territorialities are extending old ones. While windowing the release
of content by territory was an old strategy of copyright holders such as
film studios, this is increasingly difficult in an era of global
information flows. This has led to a multiplicity of coexisting
strategies such as hard territorial markets through geoblocking, hybrid
release campaigns across platforms, and simultaneous global releases.

Much like the controls of information enforced by states, the
“geographic rights management” approach behind geoblocking has been
successful in producing territorialized spaces of information through
exclusion. This process can be self-reinforcing because its deployment
in a digital network environment expands the scope of its control with
every digital copy. Lawrence Lessig has made the point that, through the
use of DRM and the internet

> \[…\] it is possible for \[copyright holders\] to centralize control
> over access to their content. Because each use of the Internet
> produces a copy, use on the Internet becomes subject of the copyright
> owner’s control. The technology expands the scope of effective control
> because the technology builds a copy into every transaction.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_23]

Yet, like states’ control of information, which is often contested (and
subverted) by groups of actors, the territorialities of information
markets advanced by copyright holders are not permanently settled. In
spite of the technical success of geoblocking technologies in
territorializing content markets, copyright holders cannot permanently
uphold their bid for control and centralization unless they offer
audiences alternatives that meet their demands. This has forced
copyright holders to seek different approaches that go beyond
centralized control of information and punishment of violations.

As shown by the millions of takedown notices collected by the Chilling
Effects project of the Berkman Center and the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, it is common practice for copyright holders such as media
companies, film studios, and states to demand the removal of copyrighted
content from video streaming websites such as YouTube. However, while
states seek to map their sovereignty and borders onto information
networks, the profit-seeking logic of market actors is reflected in more
malleable territorialities of information. For example, while the
punishment of piracy was a key strategy to keep digital market spaces
under control, copyright holders have opted to complement this approach
with strategies aimed at capturing the lost revenue outside of the
borders of these markets. Several studios have realized that if
consumers are demanding video streaming online then the takedown notices
and restrictions on streaming sites should be coupled with legitimate
supply alternatives that address such unmet demand. That is how the
service Hulu was born in 2008, which offers free streaming audiovisual
copyrighted content available anytime with reduced commercial breaks. In
a similar fashion, the television network websites are now offering part
of their media catalogs in streaming content free of charge.

These alternatives are premised on the capacity of the copyright holders
and distributors to enforce access controls on a territorial basis.
These video platforms are offered within the bounds of states or regions
that can provide a legal framework, a technological infrastructure, and
a target audience receptive to the media products they offer and the
advertisements that accompany them. Hulu, for example, detects if the IP
number – which identifies the physical location of a computer – is
within the United States or Japan, the two markets where this service
operates. While for some time users abroad were able to circumvent these
controls through the use of Virtual Private Networks or other
technologies[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_24], Hulu has now blocked this possibility[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_25] –further
demonstrating the territorialized construction of their market.

These video platforms present building blocks in territorialized
information markets that have the dual aim of restricting access to a
specific territory for legal purposes and also of providing highly
differentiated marketing opportunities for their sponsors at a local
level. Since markets cannot be created only through exclusion, but
require the negotiation of supply and demand, this means that content is
not only restricted through geoblocking, but also tailored by the
information provided by geo-targeting and geographic rights management
systems. This process of delimiting an audience geographically and
constructing territorial information markets is a step towards creating
“a well-mannered marketplace”, the fabled walled garden of the internet.

Geoblocking and DRM are technical means used by market actors to achieve
territorialities that can maximize their profit. These territorialities
do not substitute existing political geographies, such as state borders,
but complement and often correlate with them. As was argued above, the
territorialities of information markets necessitate the regulatory
protection that can be offered by confining the dissemination of
(supposedly borderless) information to the physical boundaries of
particular jurisdictions. This of course allows for the application of
jurisdiction-specific copyright laws jointly with the deployment of
Digital Rights Management, which would be much more difficult to oversee
in users and markets in other locations.

The complexities of enforcement highlight the continued presence of
state institutional frameworks on the internet and the intersections
between the territorialities of states and market actors in this
environment. An example that illustrates this intersection is the recent
Megaupload case, where millionaire Kim Dotcom was apprehended in New
Zealand in 2012 at the behest of US authorities for illegally hosting
copyrighted content in his storage service. In this case the reason why
the United States Department of Justice could claim jurisdiction was due
to the location of Megaupload’s hired servers in Virginia. This
confluence of factors resulting in a claim of territorial jurisdiction
and extraterritorial prosecution is, however (for now), an exceptional
case. Needless to say, much extra-legal copyrighted content distribution
takes place outside of the bounds of jurisdictions actively protected by
legal regimes and law enforcement agencies.

In an age of intense global competition the territorialities of online
markets are increasingly important for copyright industries. Market
segmentation strategies with rigid territorialities that rely on
windowed releases are becoming increasingly difficult in light of the
fluidity and reach of digital networks. These technologies have the
potential to bring new competitors and enable current market leaders to
deploy a multiplicity of territorial strategies. While the
infrastructural advantages of Hollywood studios and Anglo-European media
conglomerates are undeniable, the competition from emerging competitors
such as Korean and Chinese media industries highlights the imperative to
adapt in order to survive. The American film production system
successfully navigated a structural reconfiguration in the middle of the
20^th^ century, when its transformation from a vertically integrated
industry to a network dominated by flexible specialization ensured its
survival.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_26] However, the challenge copyright holders face today is
unprecedented in the sense that it entails a fundamental reconfiguration
of media markets through the coexistence of multiple and shifting
territorialities.

If new and established copyright holders aim to develop markets
internationally, they must do so increasingly through digital networks.
The successful construction and profitable operation of digital markets
requires a balancing act between two countervailing forces. On the one
hand, copyright holders enact territorialities through enforcement and
control (by combining technical and legal means, such as geoblocking and
copyright law). On the other hand, (legal and illegal) competition
forces them to negotiate unmet market demand by developing alternative
territorialities through new forms of distribution. These
territorialities are built on the logic of profit-seeking, but also
intersect with technical capabilities and politico-legal frameworks
necessary to establish functioning markets. Thus, a key challenge in
this project is the construction of stable territorialities of
information markets. This requires considerable maneuvering and
negotiation between judicial systems, technology firms, content
providers, business strategies and consumer demands.

## Conclusion

Different actors have different territorial logics through which the
internet is envisioned and created. Certain actors, such as states and
firms, articulate clear territorialities based on intellectual property
regimes, markets, and internet censorship or control. The existence of
an “open” internet can be considered a techno-utopian vision at odds
with the historical development of this network.[^03AshrafandAlvarezLeonLogicsandterritorialities_27] Indeed, the word
“geoblocking” presupposes that there is something to be blocked,
necessitating a binary open/closed model of the internet. This idea
represents yet another frame of territorial logic mapped onto the
internet. However, as this chapter demonstrates, multiple actors
envision the internet less as an open network and more structured around
territorialized logics in pursuit of their own economic, political, and
social goals. Thus, the internet as a medium of experience is
heterogeneous rather than binary with multiple actors co-existing with
and creating multiple internets. This is the internet of lived
experience rather than one which is only conceptual or rhetorical: an
internet whose terrain is as varied as the globe it spans.
